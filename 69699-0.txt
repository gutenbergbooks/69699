    Morunga elephantina, _Cat. S. & W._ p. 39.

One of the Falkland Islands is called Elephant Island, from the former
abundance of Sea-elephants there; but Mr. Sclater informs us that when
Lecomte visited it, it was “found to be quite deserted by this animal,
which is said now to be entirely extinct in the Falklands, though its
former abundance in certain spots is well known, and is further testified
by remains of its bones and teeth met with on the shores, specimens of
which were obtained and sent home.”—_P. Z. S._ 1868, p. 527. See Dr.
Sclater’s previous statement, P. Z. S. 1868, p. 189.

This latter assertion is a mistake, for the bones sent home were those of
_O. jubata_, as is proved by the following remarks of Dr. Murie:—“Lecomte
and his companions believed these large old skulls of _Otaria jubata_
[which he brought home] to be those of the Elephant-seal (_Morunga
elephantina_), as it was stated by some of the party that those animals
formerly did exist on this island. One of the pilots (Louis Despreaux
by name) had resided thirty-two years on the Falkland Islands, and he
distinctly remembered shooting many Elephant-seals in the neighbourhood
in bygone years; but about twelve years ago they began to get scarce and
disappear.” And further on he observes that they are “now only rarely met
with in the Falklands.”—_P. Z. S._ 1869, pp. 106 & 109.

Muzzle very broad, truncate, convex, swollen above. Ears without any
conch. Eyes prominent. Canines very large, exserted. Cutting-teeth 4/2
in young, and 2/2 in adult; grinders all single-rooted. The anterior
feet as large as the posterior ones; the fingers decrease in a curved
line, destitute of claws; the hind feet with five toes, very gradually
increasing towards the inner, all provided with claws; palms and soles
hairy in the young, becoming chaffy. Tail rudimentary. Skull with no
postorbital processes. A distinct alisphenoid canal. Mastoid process
strong and salient, with its surface continuous with the auditory bulla.
The scapula, hinder margin nearly straight, with the spine a short
distance from and somewhat parallel with it. Resting on its body with
the fore feet extended and the hind feet doubled under it, moving by the
exertion of the abdominal muscles. (See P. Z. S. 1853, p. 112.)

Family 3. OTARIADÆ.

Nose simple; muffle rather large, callous above and between the nostrils.
Ears with a cylindrical, external conch. Arms and legs rather elongate.
The fore and hind feet fringed. Fore feet fin-like, with a scolloped
naked membrane. Palms and soles bald, longitudinally grooved, more or
less triangular. Fingers gradually diminish in size from the inner
side. Hind feet elongate, narrow, all clawless. Toes nearly of equal
length, the outer one on each side being rather the strongest (see Cat.
Seals and Whales, p. 44, f. 15). Three middle toes clawed. The fur is
generally provided with a more or less thick under-fur. Skull with a
postorbital process. An alisphenoid canal. Mastoid process strong and
salient, extending aloof from the auditory bulla. Cutting-teeth 6/4,
upper often bifid; canines conical; grinders 5/5 or 6/5. The scapula is
curved backward to the upper angle, but with its spine or crest near
the posterior margin. Testicles enclosed in the small external scrotum.
They walk on their fore and hind limbs; they rest with the hind part of
the body bent down, and the legs directed forward, like the Morse. The
females lie on their backs to receive the caresses of the male; and the
young are born on shore and are gradually taught to swim.

    Otariadæ, _Brookes, Mus. Cat._ 1836, pp. 18, 28; _Gray_, _Ann.
    & Mag. N. H._ 1869, iv. p. 268; _Gill_, _Proc. Essex Inst._

    Arctocephalina, _Gray_, _Cat. S. & W._ p. 44.

The Eared Seals (Otariadæ) form a distinct family from the Earless
Seals (Phocidæ). They have more power of using their limbs like the more
typical mammalia, walking on them with the body raised from the ground;
they rest with their hind limbs bent forwards. These habits are well
shown in Dr. Forster’s figures, engraved by Buffon; and they have been
verified by the study of the living Eared Seal in the Zoological Gardens.
Their scrotum and genital organs are exposed as in the Dog.

The _Otariæ_ come to the surface during the process of mastication, and
do not, like the Eared Seals, swallow under the water. They do not drink,
while the common Seal occasionally sucks in water as a horse would. The
pupils of the eyes dilate and contract to an enormous extent.

The Sea-bears (_Otariadæ_) inhabit the more temperate and colder parts of
the southern hemisphere, and the temperate and more northern regions of
the Pacific Ocean.

The _Otariæ_ appear to make periodical migrations towards the south; and
the Sea-lions (_O. jubata_) come to the Falkland Islands in November,
where they remain till June or July, when the greater number depart; but
some remain there the whole year round (P. Z. S. 1869, p. 108).

Navigators, from the general external resemblance of the animals, have
regarded the Sea-lion and Sea-bear of the northern and southern regions
as the same animal. Pennant (who paid considerable attention to Seals)
and most modern zoologists have done the same.

Nilsson, in his excellent Monograph of the Seals, only mentions three
species of Eared Seal:—1, _Otaria jubata_; 2, _O. ursina_; and, 3,
_O. australis_. He believed that the first was common to the Falkland
Islands, Chile, Brazil, New Holland, and Kamtschatka, and the second to
Magellan’s Straits, Patagonia, New Holland, and the Cape. We now know
that the species have a very limited geographical distribution.

When I published my ‘Catalogue of the Seals in the British Museum,’ in
1850, I was satisfied from Steller’s description that the species he
described from the Arctic regions were distinct from those found in the
Southern seas; and when I at last succeeded in obtaining specimens and
skulls from the northern regions of the Pacific, I not only found that my
idea was confirmed, but that they did not even belong to the same genera.
I had the skulls of these species figured in the ‘Proceedings of the
Zoological Society’ for 1859, and this greatly extended the knowledge of
the animals. But there is yet much to be learnt respecting them. We do
not know the species of Fur-seal described by Forster as inhabiting the
coast of New Zealand.

The skull of these animals changes so much in form as the animal
arrives at adult and old age that it is not always easy to determine
the species by it, unless you have a series of them, of different ages
and states, to compare. Thus Dr. Peters, in his revision of the genus
after the publication of my Catalogue and figures of the skulls in
the ‘Voyage of the Erebus and Terror’ and in the ‘Proceedings of the
Zoological Society,’ formed no less than five species from the skulls of
the southern Sea-lion (_Otaria jubata_)—_O. jubata_, _O. Byronia_, _O.
leonina_, _O. Godeffroyi_, and _O. Ulloæ_,—referring the first four to
the subgenus _Otaria_, and the last to _Phocarctos_ (see Monatsbericht,
May 1866, pp. 265, 270). In his second essay, published a few months
later (_ibid._ Nov. 1866), after his visit to London, he placed them all
together in one subgenus (_Otaria_), and seems, by the way in which he
has numbered four of them, to doubt their distinctness. It would have
been better if he had at once simply reduced them to synonyms (as they
must be reduced) and included with them _O. Ulloæ_, which is only the
skull of a young specimen, such as was called _O. molossina_ by Lesson
and Garnet. I may observe that I had shown in my first ‘Catalogue of
Seals’ (1850), from the examination of the typical skull, that two or
three of these nominal species were only very old or young skulls of the
southern Sea-lion.

It is the character of the Eared Seals or _Otariadæ_ to have a very
close, soft under-fur between the roots of the longer and more rigid
hairs. They are therefore called _Fur-Seals_ by the sealers, and are
hunted for their skin as well as for their oil. The quantity and fineness
of the under-fur differ in the various species; and the skin and
under-fur bear a price in the market according to the country and the
species from which they are obtained.

Some species of the family have so little under-fur when they arrive
at adult age, that they are of no value in the market to be made into
“seal-skins;” these are therefore called _Hair-Seals_ by the sealers.
They are only collected for the oil, as the skins are of comparatively
little value.

The skins of the Fur-Seal are much used in China, and are more or less
the fashion in this country, sometimes being far more expensive than at
others. The skins of the Hair-Seals are only used, like the skins of
the Earless Seals or _Phocidæ_, for very inferior purposes, as covering
boxes, knapsacks, &c.; but the animals are much sought after for the oil
they afford.

The furs of the different species of Fur-Seals are exceedingly different
in external appearance, especially in the younger specimens, or when
the fur is in its most perfect condition. In most species the hairs are
much longer than the under-fur; they are flat and more or less rigid
and crisp. In others the hairs are short, much softer, scarcely longer
than the soft woolly under-fur; in these species the fur is very dense,
standing nearly erect from the skin, forming a very soft elastic coat, as
in _O. falklandicus_ and _O. Stelleri_.

The hair of _O. nigrescens_ is considerably longer than that of _O.
cinerea_, but not so harsh, the fur of the half-grown _O. nigrescens_
being longer, sparse, flat, rather curled at the end, giving a crispness
to the feel; while the hairs of the very young specimens are abundant,
nearly of equal length, forming an even coat that is soft and smooth to
the touch.

The length, abundance, and, indeed, the presence or absence of the
under-fur greatly depend on the season at which the specimen is obtained
or observed. It is true that the sealers call some seals hair- and others
fur-seals; but that is only because what they call hair-seals never had
more than a very small quantity of under-fur in the fur-season; but, on
the other hand, many fur-seals at some seasons have only a small quantity
of the under-fur which is so long and abundant at other periods.

Difficult as it is for the zoologist to distinguish the species by their
external appearance, the skins of the different species of Fur-Seals are
easily distinguished by the dealers, even when they are wet, showing
that the practical fellmonger is in advance of the scientific man in
such particulars, as the dealers in whalebone were in regard to the
distinction of the species of the Whale by their baleen (see Zool. Erebus
& Terror).

The longer hairs of the Fur-Seals are very slender and pale-coloured at
the basal half of their length, and thicker and darker at the upper half,
and often have a white tip. The basal half is subcylindrical, the upper
half is flat, tapering at each end. The absolute length of the under-fur
differs in the various species. Judging from the old and young specimens
of _A. nigrescens_, the hairs seem to be longer, both absolutely and
relatively to the under-fur, in the young than in the adult animals.
The hairs of the Hair-Seals are shorter, flat, channelled above, and
gradually tapering from the base to the tip, merely contracted at the
insertion into the skin. The breadth of the hairs seems to vary in the
different species; and in the younger specimens there are to be observed
some soft hairs like the under-fur of the Fur-Seals.

The _Fur-Seals_ are _Callorhinus ursinus_, _Arctocephalus antarcticus_,
_A. nigrescens_, _A. cinereus_, _A. Forsteri_, _A. falklandicus_,
_Eumetopias Stelleri_, _Arctophoca Philippii_.

The _Hair-Seals_ are _Otaria jubata_, _Phocarctos Hookeri_,
_Arctocephalus nivosus_, _Zalophus Gilliespii_, _Neophoca lobatus_.

Dr. Peters, in his two papers on the Eared Seals (_Otaria_) uses the
length of the ears and the existence or non-existence of the under-fur,
as well as the characters used by Mr. Gill and myself, to separate the
species of these animals into subgenera.

The length of the ears may probably afford good characters for the
separation of the species and groups, if they can be observed in the
living animals. As yet, only one species of these animals, the Sea-lion
or Sea-bear (_Otaria leonina_), has been observed alive in Europe; so
that Dr. Peters’s notes could only be derived from the examination of
more or less carefully preserved skins; and, I fear, little dependence
can be placed on them.

The form of the hinder opening of the nostrils and the form of its front
edge, when only one or two skulls of a species were examined, have been
regarded as constituting a good character; but when an extensive series
of the skulls of a single species, or of several species, have been
examined, that part is found to vary considerably as to the width of its
different parts, and especially in the form of its front edge. As far as
my observations have extended, the hinder opening of the nostrils appears
to become narrower, and especially its front edge, as the animal becomes
adult or aged; and in the skulls of the younger specimens it is broader,
shorter, and the front edge is broader and more truncated or straight,
with only a slight rounding at the sides.

The position of the grinders as regards the front part of the zygomatic
arch is a good character for the distinction of the species, especially
if a series of skulls from animals of different ages, and from the same
locality, of each species are compared together; and it is the same
with the rooting of the grinders themselves. But when adult skulls of
different species are compared together, the forms of the skulls are so
altered, the grinders generally so worn and altered by age, and their
position in different species so similar, that the distinction of the
species then becomes more difficult.

The flap of thick bald skin produced beyond the hinder toes varies in
length as compared with the toes, in the length of it before it divides
into lobes, and the length of the lobes themselves in different species,
and thus affords characters for their separation; but it is difficult to
determine the proper length of it and its parts from a preserved specimen
in the Museum. It is apt to be unnaturally stretched in length and width
by the preparer, and it shrinks as it dries long after it is placed in
the Museum.

If I am not deceived by the prepared skins, the flap appears to be
longer in the adult than in the young specimens; and judging from
the specimens in the Museum, it is longest in _Callorhinus ursinus_,
and it gradually becomes shorter in _Arctocephalus antarcticus_, _A.
falklandicus_, _Phocarctos Hookeri_, _A. cinereus_, _Otaria jubata_, and
_A. nigrescens_. It is very short in _Neophoca lobata_ and _Eumetopias
Stelleri_.

The “Prodrome of a Monograph of the Pinnipedes,” by Mr. Theodore Gill,
wherein he named several genera of this group, and a paper by Dr. Peters
on the _Otariæ_ of the Berlin Museum, in the ‘Monatsbericht’ for May
1866, have induced me to reexamine the skulls and skeletons in the
British Museum.

I may observe that Dr. Peters considers all the Eared Seals one genus,
but has divided them into seven subgenera, to each of which he gives a
distinctive name. Dr. Peters’s paper is interesting as determining the
specimens described by Pander and D’Alton, Johann Müller, and other
German naturalists, as well as describing the more recently received
specimens in the Berlin Museum, which certainly is one of the most
important on the Continent.

Captain Thomas Musgrave, in a work entitled ‘Cast away on the Aucklands,’
12mo, 1866, pp. 141 and following, gives a very interesting account of
the habits and manners of the Lion-seal, showing how unlike they are in
their habits to the Seals without ears (Phocidæ). The female brings forth
her young far inland, and has to teach them to take to the water which is
to be their future home.

Captain Weddell gives nearly the same account of the habits of the
Fur-Seal, as does also Mr. Hamilton (in Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. 1839, p.
87).

Mr. J. A. Allen, in the ‘Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology’
at Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass., has published (1870) an essay
on the Eared Seals (Otariadæ), with detailed descriptions of the
North-Pacific species.

He divides the family into subfamilies:—

Subfam. 1. _Trichophocinæ_, without under-fur, and containing the genera
OTARIA, EUMETOPIAS, ZALOPHUS.

Subfam. 2. _Eulophocinæ_, with thick under-fur, containing CALLORHINUS
and ARCTOCEPHALUS.

He gives figures of the skulls of different ages of the North-Pacific
species.

Mr. Allen had only the skins in salt and the bones of two North-Pacific
species to study, and he does not seem to be aware that the abundance
of the under-fur greatly depends on the season and age of the animal
when collected; and unfortunately he seems to have had no specimens or
skulls of the southern species to enable him to study their characters;
yet with these limited materials he has ventured to propose a revision
of the species of Otariadæ, and, from the same cause, has suggested
the uniting of many incongruous species together. It may be very true
that zoologists have erred (myself among the number) in making too many
genera and species; but the correction of this error requires as much
study and consideration of the entire subject as have been used in their
determination; and science is not advanced by hasty alterations founded
on a few specimens.

The Eared Seals are collected for their oil and skins. Most of the
species have very dense under-fur of soft erect hairs between the bases
of the longer hairs. These are called “Fur-Seals;” and the skins, when
deprived of their long hairs, are very valuable. The dressed furs of
the various species and localities are of very different commercial
and economic value. The skins of _Neophoca lobata_ (of Australia) and
_Phocarctos Hookeri_ (of the Southern Ocean), being nearly destitute of
this under-fur, are called _Hair-Seals_ by the sealers. Their skins are
of little comparative value, as they are only used like the skins of the
Earless Seals (Phocidæ).

1. OTARIA.

Grinders 6/5. In the adult skulls the fourth upper grinder is under the
front edge of the orbit, and the sixth or last in a line with the back
edge of the zygomatic arch. The hinder edge of the palate is rather in
front, on the line of the condyles. The teeth in the younger skull are
more lobed than in the adult; the upper grinders are also differently
disposed; the third upper grinder is under the front edge of the orbit,
and the fifth tooth is in a line with the back edge of the zygomatic
arch, and the last or sixth tooth is far behind it (see skull, Cat. S. &
W. p. 58, f. 18). This change is remarkable, as the teeth of the young
and the adult _Zalophus Gilliespii_ are similar in number and position.

The oldest of the three adult skulls in the British Museum differs from
the other two in the pterygoid processes of the hinder edge of the palate
being closer together than in the rest; but this character seems to
depend on the greater age of the animal, as it differs slightly in the
other two specimens. In all the younger specimens, varying greatly in
size, the pterygoid processes are far apart.

Dr. Peters considers (1) _Platyrhynchus leoninus_ of F. Cuvier, (2)
_Phoca Byronia_ of Blainville, and (3) an adult specimen which is in
the Hamburg Museum, and of which he described and figured the skull as
_O. Godeffroyi_, to be distinct species. I cannot see any difference
between the skull in the College of Surgeons, on which _Phoca Byronia_
was founded, and those in the British Museum; and the figure of the
skull described as _O. Godeffroyi_ is very similar to the skull in the
British-Museum collection which I have called _O. jubata_.

This animal has the harsh fur without any under-fur of _Phocarctos
Hookeri_; but it entirely differs from that animal in the colour of the
fur. This cannot arise from the greater age of the animal, as it is not
nearly so large as the half-grown _P. Hookeri_ in the British Museum.

In the dark blackish-brown colour of the fur and the pale-brown colour
of the nape, and in the absence of the under-fur, this Seal resembles
the adult _Neophoca lobata_ from Australia; but in that species the
pale colour extends all over the crown, while in the young male _Otaria
jubata_ there are only a few paler scattered hairs on the middle of the
crown and nose.

Dr. Murie represents the skull of a nearly full-grown male and of a
female nearly of the same age (P. Z. S. 1869, p. 103. f. 1, 2). They
greatly differ, the nose and the palate being much wider in the male
than in the female, and the teeth in the male (but this may be only an
individual peculiarity) were much worn down.

He observes, “the whole of the palate is much narrower than in the male
of the same size, especially in the maxillary region, and the teeth are
much weaker and more sharply pointed.”

He observes, “The young of both sexes are alike of a dark brown or very
deep chocolate colour. The males about a year old retain somewhat of the
chocolate tint of their youth, which, however, is paler, and subsequently
changes annually as the coat is shed. The females of equal age assume a
dark grey hue dorsally, while the abdominal parts are light yellowish. As
they grow older they alter little.

“Males a couple of years old or more become of a rich brown shade on the
back and sides, and lighter or yellowish beneath. Old males alone are
maned.

“There is a sparse underwool on the young, which sensibly diminishes with
age.

“The skulls of the adult male and female differ considerably, the latter
being comparatively the narrower of the two—the former possessing a
somewhat different form of teeth, besides proportionally immense canines.

“The teeth of _Otaria jubata_ are subject occasionally to a peculiar
wearing, of a median constricted character.

“Between the female and male of this species there is a wide difference
as regards the stretch of the pectoral flippers. In the skin of the male
the breadth from tip to tip of the fore flippers is equal to or greater
than the length of the body; in the female the reverse obtains. This fact
points to greater strength and swimming-power of the former.”

3. PHOCARCTOS.

The skull elongate, forehead flat. The palate concave, deep, with a

nares oblong, longer than broad, truncate in front, the front edge in
a line with the orbital process of the zygomatic arch. Grinders large,
compressed; the fifth and sixth upper behind the back edge of the
zygomatic arch. The grinders have compressed roots; some of them have a
very indistinct longitudinal groove on the side; the fifth upper grinder
has two distinct roots. The ear-bones scarcely prominent, with a flat
lower surface. Flap of toes moderate.

I have not seen an adult skull of this genus. The skulls described are 10
inches long, but the bones are not knit (see Cat. S. & W. p. 47, f. 17).

Inhab. Falkland Islands and Cape Horn.

Pennant, in his ‘Quadrupeds,’ describes an Eared Seal, rather more than
2 feet long, the whole body of which was covered with longish hair of a
whitish or cream-colour; it was brought from the Straits of Magellan,
and preserved in Parkinson’s Museum on the south side of Blackfriar’s
Bridge (see “Eared Seal,” Pennant’s Quad. ii. p. 278). Dr. Shaw, in his
‘General Zoology,’ gave the name of _Phoca flavescens_ to this species,
and figured it (i. p. 260, t. 73).

This is very probably the young of the Hair-Seal of the Falklands,
described by me as _Arctocephalus Hookeri_, which is of a pale-yellowish
colour. Pennant does not mention the want of the under-fur.

Dr. Burmeister observes:—“We have in the Museum [at Buenos Ayres] a young
half-grown specimen [of _Arctocephalus falklandicus_] nearly 3 feet long.
From this I have taken the skull, of which I send you a description and
drawings” (Ann. N. H. 1866, xviii. p. 99, t. 9. f. 1, 2, 3, 4). From
the comparison of the figures, and especially of the teeth and the form
of the palate, with our older skull of _Arctocephalus Hookeri_, I have
little doubt that it is the skull of a specimen of that species before
the grinders were all developed. It is not the skull of _Otaria jubata_,
which the other specimen he called _A. falklandicus_ is, as proved by the
form and position of the hinder nasal openings. The figure of the young
skull differs from the older skull of _A. Hookeri_ in the British Museum
in having a notch in the middle, while the older skull of _A. Hookeri_
has a conical prominence in the same place. Such differences are found in
skulls of Seals at different ages.

The skull of the young animal described and figured by Dr. Burmeister as
_Arctocephalus falklandicus_ (Ann. & Mag. N. H. 1866, xviii. p. 99, t. 9.
f. 1 & 2), is probably the young skull of this species. It agrees with
it in the elongated form of the skull, and in the large size and great
development of the processes of the orbits.

Dr. Murie regards _Otaria Philippii_ as founded on the skull of this
species (P. Z. S. 1869, p. 108).

Mr. Allen, on the contrary, includes _Otaria Hookeri_ as a synonym of
_Otaria jubata_. One could not have a better proof of the want that Mr.
Allen had of more materials when he undertook a revision of the family.


4. ARCTOCEPHALUS.

    Arctocephalus, _F. Cuvier, Peters_.

The face of the skull elongate, forehead flat. The palate concave,
especially in front, with a thickened margin on each side near the teeth,
and then narrowed behind; the internal nasal opening elongate, longer
than broad, narrow and arched in front, the edge in a line with the
orbital process of the zygomatic arch, which is large and well developed.
Flap of toes moderate.

In the adult skull of _A. antarctica_, from the Cape, the fifth hinder
grinder has only very short rounded callous roots, which are slightly
divided into two lobes; and the hinder sixth upper grinder seems to
have a root of the same character. But not having any skulls of younger
animals, I am not able to describe what are the forms of the roots of
these two teeth in the younger state.

In the skulls of the older specimens (which are not adult, as they have
the sutures between the bones still distinct), the fifth and sixth upper
grinders have two distinct diverging roots.

The two adult skulls in the British Museum differ greatly in the width
of the hinder nasal opening, in the form of the hinder lower lateral
processes of the occipital bone, in the form of the back of that bone,
and in the shape of the condyles.

The skull from the Cape of Good Hope, in the Museum of the University
of Edinburgh, was described and figured by Dr. Turner under the name
of _Arctocephalus schisthyperoës_, in the ‘Journal of Anatomy and
Physiology,’ vol. iii. p. 113. The name is changed to _A. schistuperus_
by Dr. Günther in the ‘Zoological Record’ for 1868, p. 20. It is
evidently the skull of a half-grown animal, with all its teeth developed,
but with the sutures of the bones still apparent. It agrees in every
respect with what I should expect to be the form and structure of the
skull of _Arctocephalus antarcticus_ from the Cape; but unfortunately the
two skulls of that Sea-bear from the Cape which are in the British Museum
are from old animals; and the specimen figured by Cuvier, Oss. Foss.
v. 220, t. 18. f. 5, is also adult. It differs from the skulls of the
two adult specimens of that species in the British Museum in the hinder
nasal aperture being much extended forwards and gradually tapering to a
point in front, which reaches to the transverse palato-maxillary suture.
This peculiarity in the form of the palate, which Prof. Turner has not
observed in any other seal-skull, seems to have induced him to regard it
as a distinct species. From the examination I have made of the skulls of
Seals in the Museum and other collections, I am induced to believe that
it is an individual abnormality of _Arctocephalus antarcticus_. I have
observed a similar malformation in the palates of two other species.
I was myself misled by their structure, before I met with the other
examples, to regard a skull with such a deformity as a distinct species.

At one time I thought that it might be a peculiarity of the young state,
as it had up to that time only been observed in skulls of half-grown
animals. It occurs in half-grown specimens of _Euotaria nigrescens_; but
the skulls of the very young specimens of this Seal in the British Museum
have the front edge of the hinder nasal opening truncated and slightly
arched in form, with well-developed square palatine bones united by a
central suture just as in the adult, but broader and straighter.

It was this observation that induced me to return to my original
opinion, that the skull which I had at first regarded as a young skull
of _Arctocephalus monteriensis_ (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1859), and then as a
separate species under the name of _A. californianus_ (Cat. Seals and
Whales, p. 51), was only a monstrosity of _A. monteriensis_, as I did
in the Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. 1866, xviii. p. 232; and I am now induced
to believe that _Arctocephalus schisthyperoës_ is only an imperfectly
developed skull of _A. antarctica_.

Dr. J. R. Forster, in Cook’s voyage in 1775, observed the Eared Seal at
the Cape of Good Hope, and called it _Phoca ursina_. Believing it to be
the same as the Sea-bear he had observed in New Zealand, Thunberg, in
his list of Cape Mammalia in the third volume of the ‘Transactions of
the St. Petersburg Academy,’ iii. 322, notices this animal under the
name of _Phoca antarctica_ (see Fischer, Syn. Mam. p. 242). Dr. Peters
has applied the name of _Otaria pusilla_ to this species, believing it
to be the _Petit Phoque_ of Buffon, which has been named _Phoca pusilla_
by Schreber, and had before been named _Phoca parva_ by Boddaert. Buffon
says that it came either from India or the Levant; but it is not by its
description to be distinguished from a young specimen of almost any of
the species. It is as likely to have come from the Falkland Islands as
from the Cape, as the French had traffic with Les Iles Malouines, as they
call them.

M. de Buffon describes a small Eared Seal, which he calls a “second
Phoque” (vol. xiii. p. 341, t. 43, where it is named “le petit Phoque”),
which, he was assured, came from India, but very probably came from the
Levant; and he considers it adult, because it has all its teeth. It is
only one-fifth of the size of the Seal of the European seas (Hist. Nat.
xiii. p. 344). He further speaks of it as “le petit Phoque noir des Indes
et du Levant” (p. 345). It is evidently a young Eared Seal. The figure is
probably from the skin, with the bones of the toes and jaws, presented
to the cabinet by M. Mauduit (mentioned at p. 433. n. 1273), and said to
have come from India.

The specimen Buffon figured, then being in the Paris Museum, was thus
described by Cuvier (Oss. Foss. v. p. 220):—“Cet animal a deux pieds
de long; ses oreilles sont grandes et pointues; son pelage est fourré,
luisant, d’un brun noir très-foncé et a sa nuance blanchâtre. Le ventre
seul est brun-jaunâtre.” The teeth show that it is young.

The figure and description of the _Petit Phoque_ of Buffon have had the
following names given to them:—

    Little Seal, _by Pennant and Shaw_.
    Phoca pusilla, _Schreber_, _Säugeth_. 314 (_Peters_).
    Phoca parva, _Bodd. Elench._ 78.
    Otaria pusilla, _Desm. N. Dict._
    Otaria Peronii, _Desm. Mamm._

Fischer, in his ‘Synopsis,’ under _Phoca pusilla_, p. 252, gives the Cape
of Good Hope and Rotteness Island, on the coast of Australia, as the
habitat of the species.

The description of Cuvier much more nearly fits that of the young
_Arctocephalus nigrescens_ from the Falkland Islands. The fur of the
young Cape Seal is dark, black above and below; the hairs are slender,
and brown (not whitish) at the base; and the underside is not yellowish
brown; so that it is very doubtful if it is the young of the Cape Seal.

Dr. Peters, believing Buffon’s specimen to be a young Cape Seal, changed
the name of _Delalandii_ to _pusilla_.

In the Museum are three states in flat skins:—

1. Adult male, with slight mane, called in the sale-catalogue
“large-wig.” Fur whitish, with a few intermixed black hairs; under-fur
short, reddish. B.M.

2. Adult, without the mane, called in the sale-catalogue “middling.” Fur
reddish white, grizzled with scattered black hairs; underside of the body
darker, reddish brown; under-fur short, reddish. B.M.

3. Young, about 18 inches long, called in the sale-catalogue “black pup,”
from the Cape of Good Hope. Fur black, polished, soft, smooth, without
any grey tips, rather browner black beneath; under-fur brown, very
sparse; hairs slender, polished, black, with very slender brown bases.

Inhab. Falkland Islands, Volunteer Rock (_Capt. Abbott_).

The two skulls of this species in the British Museum agree in most
particulars; but they differ considerably in the form of the hinder
nostrils. The larger one is without its upper teeth, but the forms of the
roots are well exhibited by their sockets; the front edge of the hinder
nasal opening is produced rather further forward, and is acutely angular.
The other skull, which is rather smaller and has the teeth in good
condition, has the hinder nasal opening with a slightly arched, nearly
truncated, front edge.

Dr. Peters refers _Phoca falklandica_ (Shaw, Zool. i. p. 256) and _Otaria
falklandica_. (Hamilton, Ann. & Mag. N. H. 1839, p. 81, t. 4; Jardine,
Nat. Lib. vi. p. 271, t. 25) to this species. But as neither Dr. Shaw nor
Dr. Hamilton describes the number or position of the teeth, it is not
possible to determine if this is the _Fur-Seal_ of the sealers, collected
at the Falkland Islands, more especially as the fact of the skull coming
from the Falkland Islands is not well ascertained. See the other synonyma
which have been established on the sealers’ descriptions and figures or
the skins collected for the furriers at the Falkland Islands (Gray, Cat.
Seals and Whales, pp. 55, 56). Dr. Hamilton, who prides himself on his
figure, represents the hind legs as extended behind: but they look very
awkward in that position, the stuffer having evidently had a difficulty
in extending them.

The hair of _A. nigrescens_ is considerably longer than that of _A.
cinereus_, but not so harsh, the fur of the half-grown _A. nigrescens_
being longer, sparse, flat, rather curled at the end, giving it a
crispness to the feel; while the hairs of the very young specimens are
abundant, nearly of equal length, forming an even coat that is soft and
smooth to the touch.

Capt. Abbott’s young specimen in the British Museum chiefly differs from
the adult specimen in the same collection in the hairs being longer, more
erect, and with minute white tips, and in the face, throat, and chest
being rufous brown; but this reddish colour is common to the young of
several Sea-bears.

The skulls from Desolation Island, on the south-west coast of Patagonia,
presented to the Anatomical Museum of the University of Edinburgh by the
late Professor Goodsir, evidently belong to _Euotaria nigrescens_, the
usual Fur-Seal of the Falkland Islands and other parts of the coast of
South-west America. Two of the skulls are from adult animals, are without
the lower jaws, and have only a few worn and broken teeth, having been
rolled on the beach.

The other skull is of a young animal, exactly similar to the skull
of a young _Euotaria nigrescens_, n. 1013_e_, in the British-Museum
collection. The front edge of the hinder nostrils is as arched as in that
specimen; the teeth are rather more developed than in our skull; they
have a well-marked central lobe and a distinct small acute tubercle on
the front edge of the cingulum.

The two adult skulls are very like the adult skull of _E. nigrescens_,
1013_d_, in the British Museum; but the opening of the internal nostrils
is narrower, and their front edge in one is not nearly so angular, and
in the other it is rather more arched than in either of the other two
skulls, showing that the size of the posterior nasal aperture and the
form of its front edge vary in different specimens of this species.

The comparison of the young skull with the more adult one shows that the
grinders change their position considerably as regards the front edge of
the hinder nasal opening. In the young skull of _Euotaria nigrescens_
the hinder end of the tooth-line is very near (not a quarter of an inch
from) a line level with the front edge of the internal nasal opening,
and the hinder part of the palate in front of the aperture is nearly as
broad as the middle of the palate: in the adult skull the hinder end of
the tooth-line is a full inch from the front edge of the internal nasal
opening, the hinder part of the palate is contracted toward the internal
nostril, and the internal nasal opening is lengthened and narrowed; but
the real position of the teeth, as compared with the front part of the
zygomatic arch, is little altered, though the form of the palate gives
them the appearance of being more changed than they really are.

These skulls are interesting as showing that _Euotaria nigrescens_, like
_Otaria leonina_ and _Morunga elephantina_, is, or was, common to the
Falkland Islands and the west coast of South America.

The chief character by which the adult skull of _Euotaria nigrescens_
can be distinguished from the adult skull of _Arctocephalus antarcticus_
is, that the hinder or fifth upper grinder and the penultimate or fourth
are placed rather in front of the hinder edge of the front part of the
zygomatic arch; but the position of the teeth is most distinctive in the
skull of the young animal, and loses much of its importance in comparing
old skulls together, unless the skulls and teeth are very accurately
compared; and even then the distinction is more imaginary than real.

I cannot understand Capt. Abbott’s account of this species. He says
that “the full-grown Seal is about the size of the common English Seal.
The largest skin I have ever seen I do not think measured more than 4
feet in length, perhaps hardly so much. The hair differs in colour,
being sometimes grey, and at other times of a brownish tint; that of
the young is of a darker brown colour.” All this agrees better with
the true _O. falklandica_; but yet he says the skin of his half-grown
specimen is now in the British Museum, and that skin is undoubtedly
_Euotaria nigrescens_. Has Mr. Abbott confounded the two species in his
mind? Or did he forget the animal? for he informed me that there were no
Sea-elephants now living on the island. (P. Z. S. 1868, p. 190.)

“The bones of the pectoral limb of the Fur-Seal of commerce differ from
those of the Sea-lion.”—_Murie_, P. Z. S. 1869, p. 109.

See Lecomte’s account of the habits of these animals, P. Z. S. 1869, p.

The British Museum contains the skin and skull of a large blackish
Eared Seal, nearly 6 feet long, that was purchased of a dealer as “a
Fur-Seal from the Falkland Islands;” but, as the dealers seem always to
give that as the habitat for all seal-skins with a distinct under-coat
that come into their possession, I have quoted the habitat with doubt.
When occupied in describing the Seals of the southern hemisphere for
the ‘Voyage of the Erebus and Terror,’ I named the Seal _Arctocephalus
nigrescens_, and had the skull figured under that name; but the plate has
not yet been published, though copies of it have been given to Dr. Peters
and other zoologists. In the ‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society’
for 1859, pp. 109, 360, and in the ‘Catalogue of Seals and Whales,’ I
described the skull of this species. There is also in the Museum a skull
of a younger animal of the same species.

Capt. Abbott, in 1866, sent to the British Museum a large and a small
Seal from the Falkland Islands. The large one was examined and determined
to be the southern Sea-lion (_Otaria jubata_). The small one, nearly 3
feet long, was very similar in external appearance; and as the teeth,
which could be seen without extracting the skull, showed that it was a
young animal, it was regarded as the young of the Sea-lion, and it was
stuffed without extracting the skull, and labelled as such. This specimen
has been examined by several zoologists, among the rest by Dr. Peters,
when engaged with his paper on Eared Seals, and has passed unchallenged
until this time, thus showing how difficult it is to distinguish these
animals by their external characters alone.

Capt. Abbott, who is now residing in England, informed me that the
smaller specimen was the Fur-Seal of the Falkland Islands, that it grows
to about half as long again as the specimen sent, and that the old males
are grey from the tips of the hairs. I have therefore had the skull
extracted from the specimen; and there is no doubt that it is quite
distinct from the Sea-lion (_Otaria jubata_); and, on more careful
examination of the skin, I have little doubt, from the colour and the
character of the fur, that it is a young specimen of the Seal that I
described as _Arctocephalus nigrescens_. It is interesting as confirming
the accuracy of the habitat that I received with that specimen, and which
until this time I considered doubtful, as Pennant and others describe the
Falkland Island Fur-Seal as grey, and white beneath.

Dr. Peters, on the authority of this habitat (which I have always quoted
with doubt), has given the name of _Arctophoca falklandica_ to the animal
and skull on which I had established my _Arctocephalus nigrescens_.

In the British Museum there is the skin of a very young Seal, which was
presented by Sir John Richardson as the Falkland Island Fur-Seal, with
the observation appended that the adult is 5 feet long, and its skin is
worth fifteen dollars. It is without its skull. The fur of this young
Seal is dark brown, reddish beneath, and very like that of the young
specimen sent by Capt. Abbott; but the hairs are smoother, and the
white tips to them are longer and more marked, giving the animal a more
grizzled appearance.

There is another young Eared Seal, very like the former, which was
received with General Hardwicke’s Collection (who, no doubt, purchased
it of a dealer), said to have come from the Cape of Good Hope. I suspect
this habitat must be erroneous; for it is very unlike what I recollect
of the young Cape Eared Seals, which are called “Black Dogs,” on account
of the blackness of their colour. Unfortunately we have no specimen of
the latter in the Museum collection. General Hardwicke’s specimen only
differs from Sir John Richardson’s in being less punctulated with white;
fewer hairs have a white tip, and the tip is shorter.

Both these young specimens differ from the half-grown one obtained from
Capt. Abbott, in the fur being softer and smooth to the touch; and Capt.
Abbott’s specimen differs from the adult in the length and greater
crispness of its fur, the fur of the old one being harsh and hard and
closer pressed.

In the first essay, Dr. Peters places _Phoca falklandica_, Shaw, and
_Otaria nigrescens_ together, with doubt, observing that one was known
from the skin, and the other by the skull, overlooking the fact that
the name _nigrescens_ implied that I had seen the colour of the fur,
which was not that given by Shaw to his animal; in his second essay, Dr.
Shaw’s, Dr. Burmeister’s, and my animal are all classed together without
any doubt.

The skull of Capt. Abbott’s Fur-Seal from the Falkland Islands shows that
it was a very young animal, which had only developed its first grinders,
the permanent series being developed below them. The tentorium is bony
and well developed. The teeth are the same in position and number as
they are in the adult skull; and the upper ones, as far as developed,
are small and conical, except the fifth upper grinder, which is largest,
triangular, with a single subconical lobe on the base of the hinder
edge of the cone. The lower canines are small, scarcely larger than the
cutting-teeth, which are nearly uniform in size. The lower grinders are
of a much larger size than the upper ones in the adult skull, as if they
belonged to the permanent series: they are of the same form as the teeth
in adult skulls; but the central cone is higher and more acute, and the
anterior and posterior lobes at the base of the cone are more developed
and acute, the lobes of the last or fifth grinder being larger and rather
on the inner surface of the tooth.

The skull of Capt. Abbott’s animal is evidently not the same as the
skull of a young Eared Seal described and figured by Dr. Burmeister as
the skull of _Arctocephalus falklandicus_ from the mouth of the Rio de
la Plata, in the Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. ser. 3, vol. xviii. p. 99, t. 9,
which, from the appearance of the grinders, I suspect is the young skull
of _Phocarctos Hookeri_, the Hair-Seal of the Falkland Islands. There is
a considerable difference in the proportions of the skull sent by Capt.
Abbott from those of the one figured by Dr. Burmeister. In Capt. Abbott’s
specimen the brain-case, from the back edge of the orbit to the occiput,
is as long as the length of the face, from the same edge of the orbit to
the end of the nose. In Dr. Burmeister’s figure, the face from the same
point is much longer than the brain-case.

There are the stuffed skin, with its skull, and the bones of the face of
another young specimen of this Seal in the British Museum, collected in
the Australasian Sea by Mr. John Macgillivray.

According to the observations of Dr. Peters, founded on the examination
of the typical skulls, _Otaria ursina_ of Nilsson and _Otaria Lemarii_
of J. Müller (Arch. f. Naturg. 1841, p. 334) include the _Arctocephalus
antarcticus_ from South Africa and _A. cinereus_ of Australia.

_Otaria Stelleri_ of Schlegel (Fauna Japonica, t. 22. f. 55) includes
both the Australian Eared Seals, viz. _Arctocephalus cinereus_ and
_Neophoca lobata_; and it is quite distinct from the _Otaria Stelleri_ of
Lesson and T. Müller, which is a combination of the Sea-bear and Sea-lion
of Steller (that is to say, _Eumetopias Stelleri_ and _Callorhinus
ursinus_).

The males of these animals are described as twice as long and broad
(that is, four times as large) as the females. This may explain the
difference in size of the skulls from the same localities.

The fur changes its colour as the animal grows, the young being generally
black; and the adult males and females also differ considerably in the
colour of the fur.

The skulls of the following species are not known:—


4. Arctocephalus Forsteri.

Grinders 6/5·6/5, conical.

    Hist._ 1868, i. p. 219.

    Phoca ursina, _J. R. Forster_.

Inhab. Cloudy Bay, New Zealand.

This animal is only known from Dr. Forster’s description and figure.

Mr. Allen observes, “I can see no evidence of the New-Zealand Fur-Seal
(of Forster) being specifically distinct from the Fur-Seal of Australia,
_A. cinereus_ (auct.).”—_Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool._ ii. p. 15.

At the same time Mr. Allen ventures to remark, “perhaps the _A. cinereus_
and the _A. antarcticus_ are to be referred to the _A. falklandicus_, in
which case the habitat of this species is the southern seas generally”
(Bull. Comp. Zool. ii. p. 45): but he does not seem to have had specimens
of any of the three species; otherwise I do not think he would have
ventured upon the observation.

Unfortunately, having no skull or other parts of the Lion Seal of the
Auckland Islands (the most southern of the New-Zealand group), we are
not able to determine whether it is the same species as the Sea-lion
of the southern end of the American continent (_Otaria jubata_), or
whether it is the Sea-lion of the southern end of the African continent
(_Arctocephalus antarcticus_), or the Sea-lion of the Northern Australian
Seas (_Neophoca lobata_).


5. Arctocephalus falklandicus.

Fur very soft, elastic; hairs very short, exceedingly close, slender at
the base, thicker above, with close reddish under-fur nearly as long
as the hair; the upper surface pale, nearly uniform grey, minutely
punctulated with white; hairs brown, upper half black, with minute white
tips. The nose, cheeks, temples, throat, chest, sides, and underside of
the body yellowish white.

    names are all from the same animal.

Inhab. Falkland Islands (_Abbott_; _B.M._); New Georgia.

This is a most distinct species, and easily known from all the other
Fur-Seals in the British Museum by the evenness, shortness, closeness,
and elasticity of the fur, and the length of the under-fur. The fur is
soft enough to wear as a rich fur without the removal of the longer
hairs, which are always removed in the other Fur-Seals. Unfortunately the
specimen is without any skull; and therefore I cannot give a description
of the teeth, or refer it to any of the restricted genera of _Otariadæ_.

Mr. R. Hamilton, in the ‘Annals of Natural History’ for 1838, ii. p. 81,
t. 4, gives the history of the Fur-Seals of commerce and the method of
catching them; and he deposited two specimens in the Museum of Edinburgh,
which had been procured by Capt. Weddel. Mr. Abbott having informed me
that what I had described under the name of _Arctocephalus falklandicus_
is not now found in the Falkland Islands, and Mr. Bartlett having shown
me an imperfect skin of the same species, which he had obtained from
a fur-monger, who informed him that such fur-skins were only received
from the Arctic part of the Pacific Ocean, I was induced to request Mr.
Archer, director of the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art, to allow me
to examine the Seals described by Mr. Hamilton, which, on examination,
proved to be my _Arctocephalus falklandicus_, only differing from the
Museum specimen in the fur being considerably darker and harsher; and,
from Capt. Weddel’s account as given in the ‘Annals,’ these specimens
came from South Georgia or South Shetland. These Seals, which were
brought from the Antarctic Ocean, may formerly have inhabited the
Falkland Islands, and, like the Sea-lion found there by Pernetty, have
been destroyed or driven away. _Arctocephalus Hookeri_ is said to be now
found in the Antarctic Ocean and the Falkland Islands. In that case it
may be the Falkland-Island Seal of Pennant.

The _A. falklandicus_ is very like the Fur-Seal from Australia (_H.
cinereus_) in the length of the under-fur as compared with the length of
the hairs, and also in the colour of the under-fur and hair; but the fur
is much softer, and its general colour is much darker, both above and

Pennant describes the “Falkland-Island Seal” from a specimen 4 feet
long, in the museum of the Royal Society, thus:—“Hair short, cinereous,
tipped with dirty white;” “grinders conoid, with a small process on one
side near the base.” It is to this description that Dr. Shaw applied the
name of _Phoca falklandica_ (Gen. Zool. i. p. 256). This agrees with
a specimen in the Museum in all particulars. It certainly is not the
dark blackish-brown Seal which I have described as the _Arctocephalus
nigrescens_, and which Dr. Peters calls _O. falklandica_.

I sent a piece of the fur of this Seal to Dr. Peters to be compared
with the fur of _O. Philippii_. He observes, “They appear to be quite
different; the wool of _O. falklandica_ is fair and has more similarity
in colour to the young of _O. cinerea_. The wool of _O. Philippii_ is
entirely ferruginous red, and the longer hairs are stiffer and have a
much shorter grey tip than in _O. falklandica_.”


6. Arctocephalus? nivosus. _Cape Hair-Seal._

                                                                      B.M.

Fur very short, close-pressed, black, varied with close, small, often
confluent, white spots; underside of the neck with a few scattered white
hairs; belly red-brown (nearly bay); hairs short, thick, of one colour
to the base; under-fur none, except a very few hairs on the crown of the
head. Skull unknown.

    Arctocephalus? nivosus, _Ann. & Mag, N. H._ 1868, i. p. 219.

Inhab. Cape of Good Hope. B.M.

Length of skin nearly 8 feet; but stretched and flattened.

Dr. Murie (P. Z. S. 1869, p. 108) says that this is only a variety,
seasonal, sexual, or of a different age from the specimens hitherto
obtained.

Mr. Allen adopts this view, never having seen the specimen, but changes
the phrase into “a previously known species” (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. ii.
p. 18); but neither of them mentions the species to which he refers it.

But surely Mr. Allen does not mean that it is only a variety of the skins
which were received with it from the Cape of Good Hope; for, if that were
the case, the species would belong to one of his subfamilies, and the
variety to the other.

In the form and length of the hair it is very different from
_Arctocephalus antarcticus_; and it is almost destitute of under-fur,
except on the crown of the head.


Tribe IV. _ZALOPHINA._

Grinders 5/5·5/5, large, thick, in a close continuous series; the fifth
upper in front of the back edge of the zygomatic arch.

In the younger skull the grinders are placed rather further back, the
hinder part of the upper grinder being behind the back edge of the
zygomatic arch. The grinders all single-rooted, as the last or sixth
grinder in each jaw, which is generally two-rooted, is absent. The face
of the skull is considerably produced, and the forehead is flat.

    Zalophina, _Gray_, _Ann, & Mag. N. H._ 1869, iv. p. 269.


5. ZALOPHUS.

Palate concave, narrow in front, wider at the line of the last grinder,
and then contracted behind. The hinder nares narrow, elongate, twice
as long as wide, acutely arched in front, front edge in a line with the
front edge of the orbital process of the malar bone. Under-fur sparse.

I have not seen any skull or specimens from Japan; so that I am not quite
sure that the specimens from the coast of Asia are the same as those from
the west coast of America.


6. NEOPHOCA.

Palate concave, broad, as broad before as at the hinder part of the
tooth-line, then rather suddenly contracted. The hinder nares broad,
rather longer than broad, with the front edge broadly arched, which is
further back than the front edge of the orbital process of the zygomatic
arch, or malar bone, which is thick and flat. Fur with very little
under-fur. Flap of toes moderate.

The upper grinders all single-rooted, the root of the last two (the
fourth and fifth) being rather compressed, with an obscure central
longitudinal groove on the inner side; the first two grinders of the
lower jaw with oblong, the last three with compressed roots, and the
fourth and fifth with a slight longitudinal groove on the side.

In the younger skulls the roots of the grinders are more oblong, less
compressed, and do not show the lateral grooves, as far as the teeth can
be seen without being drawn from the sockets. In the front part of the
younger skull, which was received from Mr. Gould, the teeth are placed
rather further back than in the adult skull from North Australia received
from Capt. Grey, the hinder part of the fifth tooth being behind the back
edge of the zygomatic arch.

Mr. Allen thinks that this is undoubtedly the _O. cinerea_ of Desmarest,
from Péron; but it is not the _O. cinerea_ of Quoy & Gaimard (see obs. on
Péron’s Seal in the Cat. Seals & Whales, p. 57).


Tribe V. _EUMETOPIINA._

Grinders 5/5·5/5, more or less far apart; the hinder upper behind the
hinder edge of the zygomatic arch, and separated from the other grinders
by a concave space.

    Eumetopiina, _Gray_, _Ann. & Mag. N. H._ 1869, iv. p. 269.


7. EUMETOPIAS.

    Eumetopias, _Gill_, _Peters_.

    Arctocephalus § _a_***, _Gray_, _Cat. Seals & Whales_, p. 51.

Fur without any under-fur. Palate flattish or rather concave in front, as
wide in front as at the end of the tooth-line, and then slightly narrowed
behind. Posterior nares oblong, elongate, broadly truncated in front, the
front edge being behind the line of the orbital process of the zygomatic
arch. The grinders have large oblong roots; the second, third, and fourth
upper ones have a subcentral longitudinal groove on the outer side, and
a less marked one on their inner surface; the inner side of all but the
first of the lower ones are similarly grooved; the fifth upper grinder
(or, more properly, the sixth in the normal series) has two distinct
roots. The lower jaw much more elongate than that of _Otaria jubata_, the
hinder angle more oblique, and the lower margin long and straight. Flap
of toes short.

The skull of the young animal, which was sent by Mr. A. S. Taylor to
Mr. Gurney from California, and which I first described, with doubt, as
_Arctocephalus monteriensis_, junior (P. Z. S. 1859, p. 357), and which
in the ‘Catalogue of Seals and Whales’ I named _A. californianus_ (see p.
51), agrees in every respect in its dentition with the large skull which
we received from California, and which I described and figured as _A.
monteriensis_ (P. Z. S. 1859, p. 358, t. 72); but it differs greatly in
the form of the hinder nares, which are extended much more forwards, so
that the front end, which is very narrow and acute, is much in front of
the prominence of the orbit of the zygomatic arch, being, in fact, about
in a line with the middle of the lower edge of the orbital cavity.

This skull is evidently that of a very young animal; for the bones are
separate; but it has the same number and disposition of the teeth as the
large skull. There is the same wide space between the fourth and fifth
upper grinders; but there is at the back edge of the fourth grinder, on
the right side of the skull, a small pit, from which, no doubt, a small
rudimentary tooth has fallen out; and there is a much wider but shallow
pit on the other side, which may have been produced by the loss of a
rudimentary tooth; the last upper grinder has a large swollen undivided
root. If this is a young skull of _Eumetopias monteriensis_, that species
is curious for having the teeth in the old and young skulls in the same
situation as regards the bones of the face.

The adult skull and the young one were from the same locality, and, I
believe, collected by the same person; and this being the case, I am
inclined to regard them as the same, only showing a curious peculiarity
in the growth of the animal, and also showing that the form and position
of the hinder nostril probably varies as the animal increases in age.

Mr. Gill considers Steller’s Sea-bear (_Callorhinus ursinus_) to be the
type of M. F. Cuvier’s genus _Arctocephalus_, and therefore abolishes
_Callorhinus_ and gives the new name of _Halarctus_ to the true
_Arctocephali_—thus unnecessarily adding to the confusion of the generic
names of these animals. He fell into this mistake by not observing that
_Phoca ursina_, and even _Otaria ursina_, had been applied to several
species from very different localities, that F. Cuvier established his
genus on the skull of _P. ursina_ of Forster, from the Cape, which he (M.
Cuvier) had named _Phoca Delalandii_, and that F. Cuvier does not figure
a skull of the Sea-bear of Steller: indeed the French collection did not
at that time, nor does it even now, possess one; and I feel assured that,
if it had, F. Cuvier would, according to his custom, have established for
it a genus distinct from _Arctocephalus_, the skulls of the two genera
being of such distinct forms.

Inhab. California; Behring’s Straits.

The skin of the young specimen which Mr. Gurney gave to the Museum along
with what was said by Mr. Taylor to be its skull (see ‘Cat. Seals &
Whales,’ p. 51) was the only skin then known to exist in museums; and
consequently I described the fur of the genus from this skin as having
abundant under-fur (see Proc. Zool. Soc. 1859, p. 358). Dr. Peters having
discovered Pander and D’Alton’s animal and skull in the Paris Museum, he
observed that the adult animal was entirely without under-fur—a fact
which has been confirmed by Mr. Allen, who suggests that the skin of
the young received from Monterey is the skin of the young _Eumetopias
Stelleri_, which, I think, is very probable. But this only shows the
difficulties that must occur in the study of animals from the very
imperfect materials which until lately existed.

The Sea-lion of Steller has been one of the zoological paradoxes.
Professor Nilsson, like most preceding authors, regarded it as a variety
of the _Otaria jubata_; and therefore I supposed it might be a second
species of the restricted genus _Otaria_. Dr. Peters has solved the
enigma by uniting it and the Seal which I described from California,
observing that the skull in the Berlin Museum, figured by D’Alton under
the name of “Steller’s Sea-lion” (_Phoca jubata_), was received from
Kamtschatka, and a second skull of an old male in the Berlin Museum was
received from Mr. Brandt as coming from Behring’s Straits.

The figure of Pander and D’Alton is so imperfect that it would have been
impossible to determine the species it represents without the examination
of the original skull; and then one sees that it may have been intended
for the species to which it is referred. The same observation is
applicable to the figure of the skull of Steller’s Sea-bear.

It is to be regretted that these skulls escaped the researches of
Professor Nilsson, who visited most museums in Europe to examine the
typical specimens.

The specimen of _Callorhinus ursinus_ now in the Museum was received from
St. Petersburg as _Otaria leonina_, or _Leo marinus_ of Steller, from
Behring’s Straits; so they evidently confound two species under that name.


8. ARCTOPHOCA.

    Arctophoca, _Peters_.

Dr. Peters described this subgenus from a specimen sent from Chili by Dr.
Philippi. It chiefly differs from _Zalophus_ in the palate being much
narrower, but rather wider behind, and the teeth rather far apart. I have
not seen any skull agreeing with these characters.

“With abundant under-fur.”

According to figures, the form of the skull and the large size of the
orbit are very similar to those of _Phocarctos Hookeri_, but the number
and form of the teeth are different.

In the ‘Monatsbericht,’ May 1866, p. 276, t. 2. _a_, _b_, _c_, Dr. Peters
described and figured with considerable detail a skull of a Sea-bear
(sent to the Berlin Museum by Dr. Philippi, who obtained it at Juan
Fernandez Island) under the name of _Otaria Philippi_, forming for it
a subgenus which he calls _Arctophoca_. In his revision of that paper,
published in the same work for November 1866, p. 671, he places it as a
synonym or subspecies of what he calls _Otaria falklandica_, which is my
_Arctocephalus nigrescens_, and not the _Otaria falklandica_ of Shaw
nor the _O. falklandica_ of Burmeister as Dr. Peters supposes, as I have
shown above. In this paper he removes _Otaria falklandica_ (that is,
_nigrescens_) from the subgenus _Phocarctos_, to which he referred it in
his first paper, and places it in his subgenus _Arctophoca_.

    Otaria Hookeri, var., _Murie_, _P. Z. S._ 1869, p. 108!

Inhab. Juan Fernandez Island (_Philippi_; in Mus. Berl.).

Above black-grey, more greyish yellow on the head and neck, brownish
black _beneath_; the base of the limbs of a rusty brown, shining; lips
and lower jaw principally rusty brown; hair of beard in six rows, partly
black, partly quite white, partly black with white base. The outbristling
(prominent bristly) pointed hairs are rusty brown at the base, black
at the end, on the back mostly with very short rusty-yellowish points,
and on the head and neck with somewhat longer ones. On the sides of the
belly the ends of the coarser pointed hairs are either uniformly brownish
black, or are very short rusty-red ones. The thick under-hair is rusty
red. The hairs on the upper surface of the neck are 22 millims. long;
those on the middle of the back 18, and those on the middle of the belly
11 to 12. The dense short hair on the back of the hand extends only to
the _middle_ of the same, not extending to the ends of the fingers, the
ends of which are furnished with very small nails. In like manner, the
very similar hair on the back of the foot does not extend to the last
“Phalangen?” of the middle toe. The nail of the large outer toe is small,
flat, and cut off short outside; that of the fifth inner toe is a little
larger and cut off abruptly on the inner side. The very developed long
nails of the three centre toes are of the form of keeled tegulæ, and
remote along their whole length by the emarginations of the skin of the
foot. The skin-flaps of the foot are equally long; and usually those of
the centre toes are much smaller than the side ones, of which the outside
one (the great toe) is the broadest. The scrotum, under the anus, is
bare.—_Peters_, _l. c._ p. 277.

I have not seen this skull; but I believe the alteration Dr. Peters made
in his second paper is a mistake. The figure of the skull of his _Otaria
Philippii_ has no resemblance to the skull of my _O. nigrescens_. It
is more nearly allied to the skull of _O. Stelleri_ from California,
agreeing with it in having a vacant space with a pit in the bone between
the fourth and fifth upper grinders on each side, looking as if a
grinder had fallen out and the cavity had been filled up. The subgenus
_Arctophoca_ of Dr. Peters’s first essay, not as modified in his second
one to contain _O. falklandica_ (_nigrescens_), chiefly differs from
Gill’s genus _Eumetopias_ (which was formed on my description and figure
of the skull of _O. Stelleri_ or _californiana_) in the fifth upper
grinder not being so far back, but in a line with the back edge of the
orbital process of the zygomatic arch instead of far behind it, as it is
in _Eumetopias_.

Dr. Murie, most curiously, considers the skull described by Dr. Peters to
be the same as I have described as _O. Hookeri_ (P. Z. S. 1869, p. 108).

Dr. Burmeister considered it _O. falklandica_ of Shaw; and Mr. Allen
(Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. vol. ii. p. 13) agrees in this opinion; but
further on (p. 15) he observes that both Dr. Gray and Dr. Murie have
“evidently overlooked the fact that Dr. Peters expressly states that _O.
Philippii_ has a _thick under-fur_, whereas both the _O. Stelleri_ and
the _O. Hookeri_ are true _hair_ Seals.” But, in fact, this statement is
a mistake as regards me; I never said that _O. Philippii_ was the same
as _O. Stelleri_, but only that its skull was most nearly allied to it,
which I still maintain.

Head large, depressed. Teeth rudimentary; they never cut the gums. Palate
with transverse, fringed, horny plates of baleen. Nostrils separate,
longitudinal. Gullet very contracted. Tympanic bones simple, large,
cochleate, attached to an expanding periotic bone, which forms part of
the skull.

The baleen of the different Whales may be divided by its structure, by
its form, and by its colour. The form and structure often go together.

The baleen consists of two parts:—1, the outer layer, called the enamel
coat; and, 2, the central fibres, which form the fringe on the inner edge
of the blade: both are well seen in cross sections under the microscope.
The outer coat or enamel differs in thickness in the different kinds.
Thus it is very thick and forms the greater part of the blade in the
Greenland Whale; and in different kinds it gradually becomes thinner,
until it only forms a thin coat over the central fibres. The central
longitudinal fibres differ in thickness and in number. When they are very
slender, as in the Greenland Whale, they form only a single layer between
the two coats of enamel, and their produced ends make a very fine, long,
flaccid fringe to the inner edge of the blade. In other Whales they
are very numerous, in many series, and form a considerable part of the
thickness of the whalebone, and make a more or less broad and rigid
fringe to the blade. In some the fibres are so thick and rigid that they
do not droop, but form an erect ragged edge to the short and broad blade,
so rigid, indeed, that the fibres of this kind of whalebone are used to
make brushes and brooms.

The whalebone varies in form, from being narrow, elongate, many times as
long as it is broad at the base, by many gradations, according to the
families or genera, until it is not longer than broad. The longest blades
have the most enamel and the finest and most flaccid fibres, which, on
the other hand, gradually (as it belongs to different genera) become
coarser and more rigid as the whalebone diminishes in length compared
with its breadth.

The whalebone or baleen offers exceedingly good and permanent characters
for the distinction and characters of the species when its structure
and form and colour are properly studied. It is stated that sometimes
the character of the whalebone is changed by its preparation, as, for
example, being soaked in water for some time before it is brought to this
country; but the soaking, although it may slightly alter the surface and
make the enamel coat rather thinner, does not alter the general form or
microscopic structure of the blades.

In my essay on Whales in the ‘Zoology of the Erebus & Terror,’ 1846,
I separated the Right Whales, or Balænidæ, into two divisions—the one
having very slender, long, polished whalebone with a single series of
fringe, and the second with coarser, shorter, and broader whalebone and
a thick coarse fringe. The first was afterwards called _Balæna_, and
the second _Eubalæna_. M. Beneden seems inclined to adopt this division
(see ‘Ostéographie,’ Cétacés, p. 144), observing that the former are
confined to the Arctic regions and the other to the more temperate
zones; but this is not correct, for _Balæna marginata_, as I stated in
my first essay, has the whalebone quite as polished and as fine as that
of the Greenland Whale. It lives on the west coast of Australia and New
Zealand, in company with the Black Whale of Australia and the Black
Whale of New Zealand (both of which, I have no doubt, have short coarse
whalebone). The Whale of the most northern parts of the Pacific yields
the north-west-coast whalebone, which is of a very coarse character.

The first section of Whales, with long, slender, elastic, polished,
finely fringed whalebone, contains two genera, _Balæna_ and _Neobalæna_.

The Whales of the second section, which have rough, brittle whalebone,
with a thick fringe of coarse hairs, includes four genera, viz.
_Eubalæna_, _Hunterius_, _Caperea_, and _Macleayius_.

It is very true that I have only seen the whalebone in one of these
genera, _Eubalæna_, in connexion with the bones of the animal; but as
“the South-sea whalers” (that is to say, those who fish in the Southern
and Pacific oceans) have only brought various examples of this kind of
whalebone from any of their voyages (except a few blades of the whalebone
of _B. marginata_, which they call “sea-tassel”), we may naturally
conclude that all the large Right Whales found in those seas have this
kind of whalebone.

Capt. Maury’s Whale-Charts show that Right Whales are found in almost all
seas, from the poles to within 35 or 30 degrees of latitude on each side
of the equator. An experienced whaler observes that “Right Whales are
as seldom seen in that belt as Sperm-Whales are found out of it.” Capt.
Maury justly observes, the torrid zone is to these animals “forbidden
ground, and it is as physically impossible for them to cross the equator
as it would be to cross a sea of flame. In short, these researches show
that there is a belt of from two to three thousand miles in breadth, and
reaching from one side of the ocean to the other, in which the Right
Whale is never found.”—_Maury_, _Whale-Charts_, p. 233.

Prof. Van Beneden, in a paper to the Royal Belgian Academy, and
reproduced enlarged in the ‘Ostéographie—Cétacés,’ gives a geographical
distribution of Whales. He acknowledges only six species, having the
following distribution:—

1. _B. mysticetus._ The Arctic Ocean on both sides of Greenland, and on
the coast of Siberia to the Sea of Okhotsk.

2. _B. biscayensis._ The North Atlantic, from latitude 65° to 45°, and a
belt across the Atlantic to the coast of the United States, from lat. 45°
to 50°.

3. _B. japonica._ A band across the North Pacific from lat. 60° to 45° on
the west coast of America and 45° to 30° on the coast of Japan.

4. _B. australis._ A belt across the South Atlantic, from lat. 25° to 30°
on the south-west coast of Africa and lat. 35° to 50° on the coast of
South America.

5. _B. antipodarum._ In a similar belt across the South Pacific from the
west coast of South America, in lat. 45°, to New Zealand.

6. A species which he does not name, said to inhabit a belt from Natal to
the south-east part of Australia, about lat. 30°.

See Dr. Gray’s observations on this theory, Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. 1868,
vol. i. p. 242, and 1870, vol. vi. p. 193, in which he observes “I think
I have proved that M. van Beneden’s theory is entirely unsupported by
facts.”

First rib slender, narrow, and undivided at the vertebral end. Tympanic
bones square; aperture nearly as long as the bone. There is at the
end of the radius and at the end of the cubitus a large cartilaginous
compartment which corresponds with the radial and cubital bone, and has
not even a bony nucleus; between these two cartilages is an intermediate
cartilage; below these are two or three carpals. Cervical vertebræ
united by their bodies. Upper lateral process of atlas broad at the base,
compressed, rather narrow, and rounded at the end; the lower lateral
process elongate, subcylindrical, angulated at the lower side of the base
(see Cat. Whales, p. 84, f. 4; Ostéogr. Cét. t. 4. f. 5-9). The lower
process of the second and third elongate and produced; the upper process
of the second, fifth, sixth, and seventh elongate, produced, and bent
forward. Bladebone with a large, compressed, elongate acromion (Ostéogr.

Dr. Robert Brown gives an account and notes of the habits and migrations
of this animal. He observes:—“Where the Whale goes to in winter is still
unknown. It is said that it leaves Davis Strait about the month of
November, and produces young in the St. Lawrence River, between Quebec
and Camaroa, returning to Davis Strait in the spring. At all events,
early in the year they are found on the coast of Labrador, where the
English whalers occasionally attack them; but the ships arrive generally
too late, and the weather at that season is too tempestuous to render
the ‘south-west fishing’ very attractive.... It is said that early in
September they enter Cumberland (Hogarth’s) Sound in great numbers,
and remain until it is completely frozen up, which, according to the
Eskimo account, is not until January.... They enter the Sound again
in the spring, and remain until the heat of summer has melted off the
land-floes in these comparatively southern latitudes. It thus appears
that they winter and produce their young all along the broken water off
the southern coasts of Hudson’s Strait, Davis Strait, and Labrador.”

He continues, “I am strongly of belief that the Whales of the Spitzbergen
sea never, as a body, visit Davis Strait, but winter somewhere in the
open water at the southern edge of the northern ice-fields. The Whales
are being gradually driven further north.”

It has been ascertained, “1st, that it is much more active than the
Greenland Whale, much quicker and more violent in its movements, and
accordingly both more difficult and dangerous to capture; 2nd, that it
is smaller (it being, however, impossible to give an exact statement of
its length) and has much less blubber; 3rd, that its head is shorter, and
that its whalebone is comparatively small and scarcely more than half the
length of that of the _B. mysticetus_; 4th, that it is regularly infested
with a cirriped belonging to the genus _Coronula_, and that it belongs
to the temperate North Atlantic as exclusively as the _B. mysticetus_
belongs to the icy sea.”—_Dr. Brown_, _P. Z. S._ 1868, p. 546.

Dr. Brown says that barnacles are looked upon as a sign of age in a
Whale; and he considers that a considerable portion of the description
of the _nordcaper_ corresponds with what he has said of the Spitsbergen
whale (P. Z. S. 1868, p. 547).

Skull rather depressed; brain-cavity nearly as long as the beak,
depressed, much expanded on the sides, with a very deep notch on the
middle of each side over the condyles of the lower jaw, and with a
subtriangular crown-plate. The nose as broad as the expanded brain-cavity
at the base, regularly attenuated to a fine point in front, and slightly
arched downwards. Lower jaw laminar, compressed, high; the upper edge
thin, and inflexed the greater part of its length, erect in front; the
lower edge inflexed in front, the rest of the edge being simple. The
baleen elongate, slender, several times as long as broad, with a fringe
of a single series of fine fibres; enamelled surface smooth and polished,
thick.

In width and general form the beak of the skull is somewhat like the beak
of some of the Finner Whales; but it does not at all justify Mr. Knox’s
idea that _Balæna marginata_ is a Finner. But this difference of skull
makes us more anxious to have the description of the entire animal and
its skeleton, as the animal may prove to be the type of a new family of
Whales, between the true Whales and Finners.

This pigmy whale, which is not more than 15 or 16 feet long, is a
representative in the Southern Ocean of the gigantic Right Whale of
the Greenland seas. It has the most beautiful, the most flexible, most
elastic, and the toughest whalebone or baleen yet discovered; and if
this were of larger size, it would fetch a much higher price than the
whalebone of the Greenland Whale, the latter being three or four times
the value of the brittle coarse whalebone of the _Eubalænæ_ or Right
Whales of the Southern and Pacific Oceans. The trade of the Continental
nations being chiefly confined to their colonies, or their merchants
obtaining the whalebone that is used in their manufactures second-hand,
there are not in the market the varieties of whalebone and finner-bone
which we have in this country, where the whalebone and finner-bone
from different localities bear each a different value. This perhaps
explains why the Continental zoologists (as Eschricht) who have paid
attention to the structure of whales have not paid sufficient attention
to the characters afforded by the shape, structure, and colour of this
substance, to which I called their attention more than twenty years
ago, and showed its value as a character for distinguishing the genera
and species. It has been a fertile subject of reproach to me that I
established some species on the characters afforded by this substance;
but I need only mention, as a proof of the little attention Van Beneden
has paid to this part of my work, that in his book on the anatomy of
Whales, now in progress, after saying that I have established the species
_Balæna marginata_ on three blades of whalebone, he says I have called it
_Eubalæna marginata_, thus confounding it with the Whales with brittle
and coarse whalebone—whereas the chief reason that induced me to consider
the blades to belong to a distinct species was their very fine and tough
structure. The accuracy of the determination is now proved by the very
different form of its skull from that of any other known Whale. In the
same manner, the _Physalus antarcticus_, also established on finner-bone
or baleen imported from New Zealand, has been proved to be a very
distinct species of that genus, named Sulphur-bottoms by the whalers.

From the description given at page 90 of the British-Museum ‘Catalogue of
Seals and Whales,’ there is no doubt that the baleen corresponds with the
above species. The specimen was obtained at Kawau Island by Sir George
Grey, and appears to be unique, as the species has hitherto only been
known from the baleen.

The dimensions are as follows:—

                             lbs.
    Weight of cranium         58
    Weight of lower jaw       13

                              ft. in.

    Width at orbit             2    5
    Width at mastoid process   2    7

                              in. lin.

“Knox now admits that this is not the Sulphur-bottom, which he says is
the Trigger of the New-Zealand whalers. He fancies that _B. marginata_
may be the true Finner of the south. I will try to find some more of the
bones.”—_Trans. New Zeal. Inst._ 1870, p. 26.

This Whale, from the form and structure of the whalebone, cannot be a
Finner, but is certainly, as I arranged it, a true Right Whale, very
nearly allied to the Right Whale of Greenland, and of a very small size.
The bones of this Whale would be a most valuable addition to the British
Museum or any zoological museum. They appear not to be uncommon in the
Kawau Islands; and the measurements of the skull are a valuable addition
to our knowledge of the species.

This small Right Whale of the Antarctic Sea is the representative of the
Right Whale in the Arctic Sea, and, judging from the length of the head,
cannot be more than 14 or 15 feet long, while the Greenland Whale is from
50 to 65 feet long.

Skull with a slender arched beak. Lower jaw subcylindrical, thick near
the condyle, rather attenuated in front.

The first rib is very narrow above, and gradually becomes very broad
below and deeply notched on the lower edge, which embraces nearly the
whole length of the sternum; upper end with a single head. Second rib
equally large at the free end, and not notched. Phalanges 1, 4, 5, 4, 3.

I believe that the “_bonnet_” of the Sandwich-Islands whalers is only the
“_topknot_” of the old male whale of this genus, or of a nearly allied
species.

are much more like those of _Macleayius australiensis_ than those of any

process being oblique, narrowed towards the base, and in the lower
lateral process being shorter, turned up at the end, and the outer end
obliquely truncated and subangular below. This massive vertebra has
no affinity with _B. biscayensis_, and indicates the existence of a
completely different new species of Right Whales, which appears to be an
inhabitant of our seas.

Mr. Cope “mentioned that he had an opportunity of examining a portion of
a specimen of the Scrag Whale of Dudley, _Balæna gibbosa_ of Erxleben,
and ascertained that it represented a genus not previously known. It was
a Fin-back Whale; but without dorsal fin or throat-folds, resembling
superficially the genus _Balæna_. The _baleen short and curved_. The
genus was called _Agaphelus_.”


1. AGAPHELUS.

Cervical vertebræ free. Fingers 4. Throat without plaits. No dorsal fin.
Ribs single-headed. Scapula with acromion (Cope, Proc. Soc. N. Sc. Phil.
1869, p. 16).

    Agaphelus, _Cope_, _Proc. Soc. N. Sc. Phil._ 1868, pp. 159,
    225; _Gray_, _Ann. & Mag. N. H._ 1870, vi. p. 200.

“Fingers four, elongate. Cervical vertebræ ⸺? Lumbar and anterior caudal
vertebræ longer than their greatest diameter. Dorsal fin wanting. Gular
and pectoral region without folds. Scapula with well-developed acromion
and coracoid. Baleen narrow, short, curved.

“The baleen is peculiar; throughout the length of the maxillary bone it
nowhere exceeded one foot in length, and the width of the band, or length
of the base of each plate, four inches. It is of a creamy white; the
fringe very coarse, white, and resembling hogs’ bristles.

“The ear-bone is much compressed, with an inferior carina, towards which
the lip of dense bone is suddenly decurved. The longitudinal opening is
much contracted, especially anteriorly, where the bone is pinched up into
a keel; and there is no abrupt concavity of the inner lip at that point.
External surface not very rugose. Total length 3 in. 2·5 lines.

“The scapula preserved is low and elongate, with well-developed acromion
and coracoid process. It is evidently of the type of _Balænoptera_
and _Physalus_; the ulna and radius relatively less elongate than in
_Sibbaldius laticeps_ and _borealis_, being 1·5 as long as the humerus,
thus resembling _Physalus_.

“The four fingers, with the second much the longest, form a fin of the
type of those genera.

“The ear-bone is much more compressed than in _Physalus antiquorum_ or
_Sibbaldius laticeps_.

“The mandibular ramus is rather massive, moderately curved, and with a
more elevated coronoid process than in any Whale that I have seen.

“The greatest peculiarity is in the form of the lumbar and anterior
caudal vertebræ; they are of a much more elongate form than any I have
seen or found figured, excepting those of the _Balænoptera rostrata_ (as
figured by Gaimard in ‘Voyage de la Recherche’), which, however, are
relatively shorter. Those of the present species are of greater length
than transverse diameter, the lumbars most elongate; all furnished with
an acute hypapophysial keel and concave sides, and entirely transverse
diapophyses. This peculiarity is consistent with the account of my
informant, who stated the animal to have been of an unusually elongate
and slender form. When it came ashore it had perhaps been dead ten days;
the flukes and muscular region as far as the third caudal vertebra had
been devoured, probably by Sharks and Killers, and the abdominal region
much lacerated; the edge of a fin preserved was slit by the teeth of
some carnivorous enemy. The measurement from the end of the muzzle to
the end of the third caudal was 35 feet, which may be reduced to 33 feet
axial. Up to this point the dorsal line was, according to my informant,
entirely smooth, without knob or fin, or scar of one; hence I suppose
the fin (if present) to have been situated, as in _Sibbaldius_ &c., at
the posterior fourth of the length, and not, as in _Balænoptera_, on the
posterior third. It may then be safely assumed, bearing in mind the form
of vertebræ, that ten feet of the whale’s length had been removed, making
in all 43 feet. That the species attains over 50 feet is probable, as
the present individual was quite young, the epiphyses separating from
the vertebræ with the greatest ease. The slender form of the animal
is corroborated by the slenderness and slight curvature of the ribs,
one attached beneath the scapula, probably the second, being narrower
than the corresponding ones in _Sibbaldius_. I therefore think it most
probable that in this form the anterior ribs are single-headed.”—_Cope_,
_l. c._ p. 223.

“The points in which this species differs from those of the genus
_Balæna_ previously known are numerous, and will no doubt be increased on
a further knowledge of the animal.

“The head, between one-fourth and one-fifth of the total length,
allies it to the shorter-headed species. From the _B. australis_ the
number of dorsal vertebræ, and the colour and shortness of the baleen,
distinguish it; and no doubt other features will be brought out when
we are acquainted with the Cape species. The dorsal serration is not
known to occur in any species of the genus _Balæna_, though said to be
characteristic of the _A. gibbosus_, whose characters I have just given.

“Two _Balænæ_ have been described as inhabiting the North Pacific
Ocean, _Balæna Sieboldii_, Gray (Catal. Cet. 1865, p. 96), and _Balæna
cullamach_, Chamisso (Nov. Act. Acad. Cæs. xii. p. 251, tab.)

“Both have been established on figures carved by the natives, of the
Japanese and Aleutian Islands respectively, the former under the
supervision of a naturalist, the traveller Siebold. The carving of the
_B. cullamach_, judging from the figure given by Chamisso, can but
doubtfully represent any species; but if the species exist, it will rest
on the following diagnosis of its describer:—‘Rictu amplo forma litteræ
S curvato, elasmiis maximis atro-cæruleis, spiraculis flexuosis, in
medio capite, tuberculo in apice rostri (ex imagine), pectore pinnisque
pectoralibus albis, dorso gibboso sexpinnato.’

“These are, however, true _Balænæ_. A species of _Agaphelus_ exists in
the Kamtschatkan seas, according to Pallas, who, however, derives his
information solely from wooden models made by the Aleutian Islanders.
This is not sufficient basis for an introduction to the scientific
system; yet Pallas indulges in applying to it the name _Balæna
agamachschik_. The pectoral limb of this species is said, however, to be
white, with the underside of the flukes, characters not found in the _A.
glaucus_. Dr. Gray has already (Cat. Brit. Mus.) indicated that this, if
reliable, indicates a genus unknown to him.

“The _Agaphelus glaucus_ is the Grey Whale of the coasts of California.
Two specimens have been examined by my friend Wm. H. Dall, of the
scientific staff of the U. S. Russian-American Telegraph Expedition, one
of them near Monterey; and descriptions, as complete as the state of the
specimens would allow, were made.

“These, which were sent to the Smithsonian Institution, and placed
in my hands by Prof. Baird, are quite sufficient to indicate a Whale
of a species hitherto unnoticed, and to render certain its future
identification.

“A second and more full examination of the _Megaptera osphyia_, Cope,
furnishes the following additional points and characters. The specimen is
young, and measures in its present condition 34 feet. It has, however,
lost a considerable number of caudal vertebræ, and, from the posterior
part of the column, of intervertebral cartilages also; add to this the
shrinking of the cartilages preserved, and the increase of length would
perhaps amount to 8 feet, giving 42 in all. The asserted length of 50
feet, line measurement, which I quoted in my original description, is no
doubt an exaggeration.

“The glenoid process is margined by an angular prominence, the rudiment
of the coracoid, precisely as in the _M. brasiliensis_. The diapophysis
of the atlas is a flat vertical plate, extending from opposite the base
of the _foramen dentatum_ to opposite the widest point of the spinal
canal; inferior posterior outline of the atlas broad, slightly concave
mesially. The mandible is peculiar in the strong angular process,
which extends from behind, round the side, projecting as far as the
condyle, and separated from it by a deep groove. The third and fourth
cervicals are united by the neural arch. The first rib is very broad at
the extremity; length 37 inches, width at end 8·22 inches. The orbital
processes of the frontal bone are not contracted at the extremities
as in _M. longimana_, but are more as in _Balænopteræ_; entire width
over and within edge of orbit 15½ in.; length to vertical plate of
maxillary 31 inches. The baleen measures 2 feet in length, is black,
with three rows of coarse bristles. Its base is one curve; its length
is spirally twisted. The species is probably one of the largest of the
_Balænidæ_.”—_Cope_, _Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philad._ 1868, p. 194.

the Abrolhos fishery is at Caravellas, or, rather, at the mouth of the
river Caravellas, where are situated the armações or trying-houses.”—_E.
Hartt_, _Geology and Physical Geography of Brazil_, p. 182.

“The fishery begins at Bahia, according to Castelnau (Expédition dans
l’Amérique du Sud, tome i. p. 750), about the 13th of June, and lasts
till the 21st September. At Caravellas I was assured that the Whales
always appeared later than at Bahia, and the fishery does not always
begin until the last week in June, continuing through the month of
September.”—_E. Hartt._

The suborders in this section have certain relations to each other by
which they may be arranged in two parallel series:—

                                          | A. Nostrils    | B. Nostrils
                                          |   separate,    |   united,
                                          |   elongated.   | transverse.
                                          |                |
    Teeth only in the lower jaw. Cervical |                |
      vertebræ often united               | Physeteroidea. | Ziphioidea.
    Teeth well developed in both jaws.    |                |
      Jaws beaked                         | Susuoidea.     | Delphinoidea.


Division I. _Nostrils longitudinal, parallel or diverging; each covered
with a valve_ (cf. p. 62).


Suborder III. PHYSETEROIDEA.

    Dolph._ p. 3.

    Physeteridæ (Physeterinæ), _Flower_, _Tr. Zool. Soc._ vol. vi.
    p. 113.

Head blunt. Nostrils longitudinal, parallel, or diverging, each covered
with a valve, the right often obliterated. Teeth many in the lower
jaw, fitting into holes in the gums of the upper one. Lachrymal bone
none distinct. “Costal cartilages not ossified. The hinder ribs losing
their tubercular and retaining their capitular articulation with the
vertebræ. The greater number of the cervical vertebræ ankylosed together.
Pterygoid bones thick, produced backwards, meeting in the middle line,
and not involuted to form the outer wall of the postpalatine air-sinus.
Symphysis of mandible of moderate or excessive length. No functional
teeth in the upper jaw. Mandibular teeth various, often much reduced in
number. Lachrymal bones usually large and distinct. Bones of the skull
raised so as to form an elevated prominence or crest behind the anterior
nares. Orbit of small or moderate size. Pectoral limbs small. Dorsal fin
usually present.”—_Flower._


Family 6. CATODONTIDÆ.

    Catodontina, _Gray_, _l. c._ pp. 386, 387.

linear, in front of the upper part of the head. Mouth inferior, linear.
Pectoral fin short, broad, truncate. Dorsal hump rounded. Skull elongate.
Crown concave, surrounded by a high perpendicular wall formed by the
doubled-up maxilla and occipital bones. Upper jaw toothless. Atlas free;
rest of cervical vertebræ united by their bodies and spines into a
consolidated mass.


1. CATODON.

    Catodon, _Gray_, _l. c._ pp. 196, 386, 387; Synops. Whales &
    Dolph. p. 3.

    Physeter, _Flower_, _Trans. Zool. Soc._ vol. vi. p. 309.

The atlas vertebra transverse, nearly twice as broad as high; the central
canal subtrigonal, narrow below. Skull nearly one-third the entire
length of the body. Lachrymal bone wanting. The zygomatic process is
formed of the malar bone. Vertebral column rough and rather spongy.
Vertebræ 50: 7 cervical, 11 dorsal, 8 lumbar, 24 caudal. The atlas
separate; the other 6 cervical united by their bodies and spines into one
consolidated mass, and sometimes united to the first dorsal vertebra.
The atlas subquadrangular, broader than long. The transverse process
truncated. Upper edge nearly straight, lower slightly curved. Neural
canal triangular, one of the angles directed downwards. The thyro-hyal
triangular, thick in front, thinner behind; the basihyal broad and flat.
The basihyal and thyro-hyal united. The ribs long, all but the first
slender and light. The first rib is short, broad, and very thick near
the lower end. Sternum large, triangular, the apex turned backwards. The
broad front end nearly straight, composed of two large anterior and a
small posterior piece. Pectoral limb small. Scapula higher than broad;
outer surface concave, inner convex. Acromion very large, dilated at the
end. Coracoid large, narrow, and about half the length of the acromion.
Humerus compressed. Radius and ulna not quite so long as the humerus,
often united at the ends and separate in the middle. The carpus wide
and short. The carpal bones six, nearly in a single row. The fingers
five, all well developed, the second, third, and fourth not differing
greatly in length, the fourth the shortest; the first consisting of two,
the second and third of six, the fourth of five, and the fifth of four
joints; the second finger two-thirds the length of the arm-bones.

The skull of the young animal is much shorter and broader than in the
adult (Flower, Trans. Zool. Soc. vol. vi. tab. 57).


1. Catodon macrocephalus.

                                                                      B.M.

Inhab. Tropical seas, accidentally in the temperate ones.

Mr. Flower (Trans. Zool. Soc. vol. vi.) considers _C. australis_, Gray,
_l. c._ p. 206, fig. 55, the same species; and certainly there does not
appear to be any character in the skeleton to divide them.

Maury remarks:—“The Sperm-Whale, according to the result of this chart,
appears never to double the Cape of Good Hope. It doubles Cape Horn.
Since this fish delights in warm water, shall we not expect to find off
Cape Horn an under-current of warm water heavier with its salt?”—_Maury_,
_Whale-Charts_, p. 267.

How far the species indicated range beyond the habitats whence they were
received is yet to be discovered and recorded. No doubt their range is
influenced by many local circumstances (peculiarities in the currents,
and disposition of the food) that are not easily observed or understood.


2. MEGANEURON.

    Meganeuron, _Gray_, _l. c._ pp. 386, 387; _Synops. Whales &
    Dolph._ p. 4.

The atlas vertebra subcircular, rather broader than high. The central
canal subcircular, in the middle of the body, widened above.

The rest of the animal not known; it is placed in _Catodontidæ_ because
this family is the only one that has the atlas separate from the cervical
vertebræ and of the simple form.

on the left side open), at the back of the forehead. Mouth small,
inferior, rounded. Dorsal fin compressed, falcate. Pectoral fin elongate,
falcate. Skull short; crown concave; hinder part of the wall formed by
the maxillaries, and divided, as it were, into two subequal parts by a
central bony ridge, which is more or less twisted towards the right side.
Upper jaw toothless. Atlas and cervical vertebræ all united into a solid
mass.

Head large, rather depressed in front. Skull ⸺?

Only known from Sibbald’s description, which, like his others, is very
specific; and all his other accounts of animals have been proved to be
correct.

Mr. Flower has no faith in Sibbald’s account of this animal, and says,
“If the Linnæan genus _Physeter_ is to be kept in abeyance until the
rediscovery of Sibbald’s ‘_Balæna macrocephala tripinna_,’ it is to
be feared that it may ultimately disappear altogether from zoological
literature.”—_Trans. Zool. Soc._ vol. vi. p. 369.

short and broad; the septum that divides the crown of the skull very
sinuous, folded so as to form a funnel-shaped cavity.

Inhab. Australia, India. Length 10 feet, young.

The difference between _Kogia_ and _Euphysetes_ does not depend on the
sex of the animals. Mr. Krefft described a male, and Professor Owen a
female specimen; the latter mistook the two drawings of the same specimen
for the two sexes, deceived by certain additions surreptitiously made to
Mr. Elliot’s drawings; but the additions, especially the penis, are not
represented on the plates, and the artist (Mr. Willis) says he received
no directions to leave out any part of the drawing, and accurately copied
them. The measurements given in the paper do not agree with those in Mr.
Elliot’s notes made from the living animal; and reference to them would
have prevented all this confusion.

“The number of the teeth in the different specimens of _Inia_ examined
shows a considerable range of variation, presuming that they all belong
to one species. In the one now described there are R. 26, L. 26 / R.
25, L. 27 = 104. The larger specimen in the British Museum, from Ega,
has 28-28/26-27 = 109, and also two minute rudimentary teeth in the gum
behind the last in the left maxilla. In the smaller skull from the same
place there are 29-26/28-27 = 110. In the skull in the Paris Museum,
brought by D’Orbigny, there are, according to Gervais, 33-33/33-33 =
132; but in the type specimen in the same museum, taken from Lisbon, the
number is given by De Bainville as 26-26/26-26 = 104. In the Berlin skull
the teeth are 34-32/33-32 = 131. Von Martius, in his diagnosis of the
species, gives 28-28/29-29 = 114.”—_Flower._

9. FERESA.

    Orca (Feresa), _Gray_, _P. Z. S._ 1870, p. 77.

The beak of the skull from the notch rather shorter than from the notch
to the condyle, depressed, flat above, gradually tapering in front; the
width at the notch two-thirds of the entire length of the beak. Lower jaw
slender, narrow and thin in front, teeth not reaching the notch.

This reexamination has convinced me, and also, I believe, Mr. Flower,
that the skull described under the name of _Orca intermedia_ belongs to
a very small species, and is not “the skull of a very young individual,
probably of one of the large species,” as Mr. Flower supposed, apparently
from the examination of the figure (see Flower, P. Z. S. 1864, p. 425).
Indeed, when the animal is known, I should not be at all astonished if
it should prove to be a species of _Electra_ rather than of _Orca_, or
perhaps a new genus.

This skull has many resemblances to those of some of the species of
_Electra_; the teeth are much smaller than those of _Orca_.

Inhab. ⸺?

This is the skull of a full-grown animal, and yet it is not so large as
the skull of a newly born specimen of _Orca_. Mr. Flower, judging from
the figure, believed it to be the skull of a very young animal; but on
examining the skull along with me he became satisfied, from the solidity
and definite form of the bones, that it is the skull of a full-grown
though not aged specimen.

In the Cape specimen the intermaxillaries are nearly of the same width in
the whole of their length; in the Seychelles skull they are contracted in
the greater part of their length, and rather dilated in front.

Mr. Swinburne Ward has kindly sent a very beautiful skull of a “Killer”
taken in the sea near the Seychelle Islands.

To determine this skull I have been induced to compare the skulls of the
genus in the British Museum, which it is very necessary to do from time
to time, as specimens gradually accumulate, and often arrive when I am
occupied on other subjects, and consequently are put aside for future
examination.

In this examination I have observed that in the ‘Catalogue of Seals and
Whales’ I have confounded with the skull described under the name of
_Orca capensis_ one from the North Pacific, the former being the true
_Orca capensis_, and the skull now received from the Seychelles Islands
being of the same species.

The skull figured in the ‘Zoology of the Erebus and Terror’ under the
name of _O. capensis_ is from a specimen received from the Zoological
Society, to which it was presented by Capt. Delville, who said he
obtained it in the North Pacific (?). It is quite a different species,
for which I propose the name of _Orca pacifica_. I doubt its being from
the _North_ Pacific, as I believe there is a skull of the same species
in the Paris Museum, collected by M. Eydoux, and said to have come from
Chili.

The skull very similar to that of the Cape species, but much smaller;
but the beak is rather narrower, the intermaxillaries moderately broad,
slightly dilated in front.

Inhab. North Sea.

An adult skull from the coast of Essex (361 _a_), and another without the
lower jaw, are in the British Museum.

These skulls of the smaller British, or, rather, European _Orca_ are
distinguishable from those of _O. gladiator_ by the smaller size and
the broader, rounder nose—and from the skulls of the Cape-of-Good-Hope
species by being of a much smaller species, and having a depressed crown
of the head.

I believe the skull figured under the name of _Delphinus orca_ by Cuvier,

form of the beak and the narrowness of the occiput: this figure has been
copied by various British and other authors.

Inhab. Mediterranean, Cette.

Skull about 22 inches long. It is about the same size as the _Orca_ from
Algoa Bay; but the brain-cavity is rather broader and the beak is not so
acute in front.

Gervais, in the ‘Zoology and Paleontology of France,’ figures the skull
of a young _Delphinus orca_, taken on the coast of Cette, which is now
in the Museum of Paris. It appears to belong to this species; or it
may be that the _Orca_ of the Mediterranean does not grow to the usual
size; or, again, it may be of a different species; for the skull is only
fifty-eight centimetres long and thirty broad.

    Dolph._ p. 8.

Skull:—beak from the notch before the orbit the same length as from the
notch to the condyle; width at the notch two-thirds the entire length
of the beak. Intermaxillaries very narrow, slightly dilated in front;
brain-cavity broad; occiput deeply concave. Lower jaw very broad on the
sides, very thick and solid in front.

Family 14. BELUGIDÆ.

    Beluginæ, _Flower_, _Trans. Zool. Soc._ vi. p. 115.

Head rounded in front. Teeth in both jaws more or less early deciduous,
rarely wanting or, rather, not developed. Back without any dorsal fin.
Pectoral fin small, ovate. Skull with the lateral expansion of the
maxilla over the orbit, and the side of the beak, shelving downwards.
Fingers short; index and middle fingers nearly the same length, the rest
rather shorter; phalanges 2, 5, 6, 4, 3. Cervical vertebræ generally
free; the second with a large dorsal process.

“The Narwhal and the _Beluga_ appear to separate themselves from all
the rest, by certain well-marked structural conditions, especially the
characters of the cervical vertebræ. As these two animals are in almost
every part of their skeleton nearly identical, even to the number of
the vertebræ and phalanges, I am disposed to look upon the exceptional
dentition of the former as an aberration of secondary importance, and to
unite the two genera into a distinct subfamily, placing it next to the
Platanistidæ.”—_Flower_, _l. c._ p. 114.


1. BELUGA.

    Beluga, _Gray_, _Cat. S. & W._ pp. 231, 306, 393; _Synops.

These are probably varieties of _B. catodon_, showing that the attachment
of the cervical vertebræ, the number of ribs, and the form of the
acromion are liable to vary.

    Ayres_, i. p. 387, tab. 23 (animal), tab. 25 & 26 (skeleton).

Inhab. South Atlantic, Monte Video.

The animal figured by Gervais as _Delphinus (Stenodelphis) Blainvillii_
(Voy. Amér. Mérid. t. 23) differs from Burmeister’s figure in having an
elongated subfalcate pectoral fin, and a higher dorsal, and a broad white
streak, commencing from the blower and extending down the back to near
the tail. If this is not a figure of the animal seen at sea, which I
suspect it must be, it must be a different species.

“Plate 6 represents the skull of a male of _Hyperoodon latifrons_ (Gray),
from the Färöer, of which the complete skeleton, 25 feet long, is
preserved in the University’s Museum.

“Eschricht believed, as is known, that _H. latifrons_ was established on
a very old male of the common Dögling, _Hyperoodon rostratus_; but Gray’s
species must now be regarded as well grounded.

“Plate 7 represents the male (fœtus) of the common _H. rostratus_. All
figures of half the natural size.”—_Reinhardt._

Though M. van Beneden’s figure (copied in Cat. Seals & Whales, p. 347. f.
69) is so unlike the figure of _Petrorhynchus capensis_ in the Cat. Seals

“One small tooth imbedded close to the tip of lower jaw on left side, 1
inch high, weight 38⅘ grains, irregular triangular shape.

“This is the skull of a young animal. A groove containing a strong
ligament connecting the muscle of the forehead with the snout is deeply
imbedded in the intermaxillary groove. The snout is described as long and
flexible. Atlas and axis anchylosed. Length of cervical vertebræ 3⁷⁄₁₀
inches. Scapula, longitudinal diameter 10 inches, transverse diameter 6
inches. Paddles, length 14 inches, width 3½ inches. Hyoid arch 5½ × 4
inches high. Pelvic bones 2½ inches.

“The specimen was cast on the beach on the west coast, and prepared by
Dr. Knox.”—_Hector._

“Your _Berardius_ proves to be quite different from the first one we got,
both in the dentition and form of the skull. We have had several good
papers on it from Dr. Knox. He has made a beautiful preparation, showing
that the tooth does not pass through the gum.”—_Dr. Hector_, letter dated
30th October, 1870.

“A fine specimen of _Berardius arnuxi_ has been cast ashore on the coast
of Canterbury, New Zealand. It was made into a skeleton, which is now in
the museum at Canterbury. The skeleton is complete, only wanting one of
the pelvic bones. It was 30 feet long, and a young animal; not a single
epiphysis is anchylosed. The cervical vertebræ, which, in the old animal
evidently form a compact mass, are still partly free; the first three
vertebræ (including the atlas) anchylosed, and of these the first two
completely, and of the second and third the neural arches are as yet not
completely united into one bone. It has ten ribs.”—_Julius Haast._

The animal was 30 feet 6 inches long.

Deep velvet-black, belly greyish, tail with two falcate lobes 6½ feet
broad. The pectoral fins are little above the middle of the body, 17
inches broad and 19 inches long, of a triangular form. Dorsal fin small,
falcate, not very far from the chin (?). “The animal has the power of
protruding the four teeth at will.” They live on cephalopods. The stomach
contained about a half-bushel of the horny beaks of the _Octopus_, which
were nearly all the same size. It was evidently a young animal, as all
the disk-like epiphyses of the vertebræ are still separate, as was the
case with the limb-bones.

The seven cervical vertebræ were beginning to coalesce; the first three
are already anchylosed, the first two completely, and the second and
third only partially, as the neural arches and transverse processes are
not yet united in one bone. It has ten dorsal vertebræ; the lumbar and
caudal vertebræ were not observed. (Dr. Haast, Annals & Mag. Nat. Hist.,
Oct. 1870.)

The form of the lower jaw gives a very peculiar appearance to the
skeleton. The cervical vertebræ are united together by their bodies and
large dorsal spines, the latter forming a thick conical process. The
bodies of the dorsal vertebræ are very small, enlarging in size towards
the tail; they are thirty-six in number. The four terminal caudal ones
are very small, forming a kind of cylindrical process. There are eight
chevron bones. The thoracic cavity is small. There are twelve ribs on
each side. The dorsal processes of the first eighteen vertebræ have an
anterior basal process, which becomes gradually smaller.

Upper arm-bone very slender, slightly curved; the lower arm-bones
moderate, straight, parallel to each other, and rather longer than the
upper arm-bone. The ribs very broad at the upper end, and gradually
tapering towards the chest, where they are nearly cylindrical.

“The total length of the skeleton, without cartilage, is 14 feet 8
inches; the head measures 2 feet 5½ inches in length, and the lower
jaw 2 feet 3 inches in length. The first three cervical vertebræ are
anchylosed; the next one is more or less free; and the remaining three
are anchylosed again. The dorsals are ten in number, the last bearing a
short rib 8 inches in length. Five of these ribs are jointed direct to
the sternum; the following two meet the cartilage of the fifth rib.

“The sternum is composed of four pieces, 20 inches long, with a width of
between 5 and 7 inches. It is not yet sufficiently cleaned to enable me
to have it photographed; this, however, will be done as soon as possible,
and copies forwarded to the Society. The lumbars number twenty, the last
nine having V-bones attached. The fifth lumbar is 17½ inches high, 4
inches wide at the top, and 11¾ inches at the base, including the side
processes. The eleventh lumbar is the widest, being 4¾ inches at the top.
The caudals probably amounted to 13; but five of these are missing; the
basal one is very small, about the size of a pea; and as it was firmly
attached to the second last, there can be no mistake about it.

“The head is 2 feet 5½ inches long and 14 inches across at the widest
part; the lower jaw 2 feet 3 inches long and 6¼ inches high behind the
tooth. The left tooth measures 6 inches in length, 3⅜ inches in width,
and is 1¾ inch thick [not well represented in the figure]. The space
between the teeth measures 7¼ inches. The limbs are very imperfect; all
the smaller bones are missing; and there is only a part of one scapula. I
did not find the pelvic bones.

“This animal was captured about a year ago, near Lord Howe’s
Island.”—_Krefft_, P. Z. S. 1870, p. 426.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
