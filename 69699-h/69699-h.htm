<h3>Family 1. PHOCIDÆ.</h3>

<p>Muffle hairy on the edge, and between the nostrils. Ears
without any conch, merely a small aperture. Arms and legs very
short; wrist very short. Toes subequal, arched, exserted. Hind
feet large, fan-shaped; the inner and outer toes large and long,
the three middle ones shorter. The palms and soles hairy. Claws
distinct, sharp. Skull:—postorbital process none or obsolete; no
alisphenoid canal; the mastoid process swollen, seeming to form
part of the auditory bulla. The scapula expanded upwards and
backwards towards the posterior superior angle. Testicles enclosed
in the body of the animal, without any external scrotum.</p>

to be identical with those that occur along the Californian and Oregonian
coast, so that there must be some error as to the assigned
habitat in the Antarctic seas—and proposes the name <i>Phoca Pealii</i>

<p>One of the Falkland Islands is called Elephant Island, from the
former abundance of Sea-elephants there; but Mr. Sclater informs
us that when Lecomte visited it, it was “found to be quite deserted
by this animal, which is said now to be entirely extinct in the
Falklands, though its former abundance in certain spots is well
known, and is further testified by remains of its bones and teeth
met with on the shores, specimens of which were obtained and sent
home.”—<i>P. Z. S.</i> 1868, p. 527. See Dr. Sclater’s previous
statement, P. Z. S. 1868, p. 189.</p>

<p>This latter assertion is a mistake, for the bones sent home
were those of <i>O. jubata</i>, as is proved by the following remarks of
Dr. Murie:—“Lecomte and his companions believed these large old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
skulls of <i>Otaria jubata</i> [which he brought home] to be those of
the Elephant-seal (<i>Morunga elephantina</i>), as it was stated by some
of the party that those animals formerly did exist on this island.
One of the pilots (Louis Despreaux by name) had resided thirty-two
years on the Falkland Islands, and he distinctly remembered shooting
many Elephant-seals in the neighbourhood in bygone years; but
about twelve years ago they began to get scarce and disappear.” And
further on he observes that they are “now only rarely met with in
the Falklands.”—<i>P. Z. S.</i> 1869, pp. 106 &amp; 109.</p>

<p>Nose simple; muffle rather large, callous above and between the
nostrils. Ears with a cylindrical, external conch. Arms and legs
rather elongate. The fore and hind feet fringed. Fore feet fin-like,
with a scolloped naked membrane. Palms and soles bald,
longitudinally grooved, more or less triangular. Fingers gradually
diminish in size from the inner side. Hind feet elongate, narrow,
all clawless. Toes nearly of equal length, the outer one on each
side being rather the strongest (see Cat. Seals and Whales, p. 44,
f. 15). Three middle toes clawed. The fur is generally provided
with a more or less thick under-fur. Skull with a postorbital process.

They walk on their fore and hind limbs; they rest with the hind
part of the body bent down, and the legs directed forward, like the
Morse. The females lie on their backs to receive the caresses of the
male; and the young are born on shore and are gradually taught to
swim.</p>

<p>The Eared Seals (Otariadæ) form a distinct family from the Earless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Seals (Phocidæ). They have more power of using their limbs like
the more typical mammalia, walking on them with the body raised
from the ground; they rest with their hind limbs bent forwards.
These habits are well shown in Dr. Forster’s figures, engraved by
Buffon; and they have been verified by the study of the living
Eared Seal in the Zoological Gardens. Their scrotum and genital
organs are exposed as in the Dog.</p>

<p>The <i>Otariæ</i> come to the surface during the process of mastication,
and do not, like the Eared Seals, swallow under the water. They
do not drink, while the common Seal occasionally sucks in water
as a horse would. The pupils of the eyes dilate and contract to an
enormous extent.</p>

<p>The Sea-bears (<i>Otariadæ</i>) inhabit the more temperate and colder
parts of the southern hemisphere, and the temperate and more
northern regions of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The <i>Otariæ</i> appear to make periodical migrations towards the
south; and the Sea-lions (<i>O. jubata</i>) come to the Falkland Islands in
November, where they remain till June or July, when the greater
number depart; but some remain there the whole year round
(P. Z. S. 1869, p. 108).</p>

<p>Navigators, from the general external resemblance of the animals,
have regarded the Sea-lion and Sea-bear of the northern and
southern regions as the same animal. Pennant (who paid considerable
attention to Seals) and most modern zoologists have done
the same.</p>

<p>Nilsson, in his excellent Monograph of the Seals, only mentions
three species of Eared Seal:—1, <i>Otaria jubata</i>; 2, <i>O. ursina</i>; and, 3,
<i>O. australis</i>. He believed that the first was common to the Falkland
Islands, Chile, Brazil, New Holland, and Kamtschatka, and the
second to Magellan’s Straits, Patagonia, New Holland, and the Cape.
We now know that the species have a very limited geographical
distribution.</p>

<p>When I published my ‘Catalogue of the Seals in the British Museum,’
in 1850, I was satisfied from Steller’s description that the
species he described from the Arctic regions were distinct from those
found in the Southern seas; and when I at last succeeded in obtaining
specimens and skulls from the northern regions of the Pacific,
I not only found that my idea was confirmed, but that they did not
even belong to the same genera. I had the skulls of these species
figured in the ‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society’ for 1859, and
this greatly extended the knowledge of the animals. But there is
yet much to be learnt respecting them. We do not know the species
of Fur-seal described by Forster as inhabiting the coast of New
Zealand.</p>

<p>The skull of these animals changes so much in form as the animal
arrives at adult and old age that it is not always easy to determine
the species by it, unless you have a series of them, of different ages
and states, to compare. Thus Dr. Peters, in his revision of the
genus after the publication of my Catalogue and figures of the skulls
in the ‘Voyage of the Erebus and Terror’ and in the ‘Proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
of the Zoological Society,’ formed no less than five species from the
skulls of the southern Sea-lion (<i>Otaria jubata</i>)—<i>O. jubata</i>, <i>O. Byronia</i>,
<i>O. leonina</i>, <i>O. Godeffroyi</i>, and <i>O. Ulloæ</i>,—referring the first
four to the subgenus <i>Otaria</i>, and the last to <i>Phocarctos</i> (see Monatsbericht,
May 1866, pp. 265, 270). In his second essay, published
a few months later (<i>ibid.</i> Nov. 1866), after his visit to London, he
placed them all together in one subgenus (<i>Otaria</i>), and seems, by
the way in which he has numbered four of them, to doubt their
distinctness. It would have been better if he had at once simply
reduced them to synonyms (as they must be reduced) and included
with them <i>O. Ulloæ</i>, which is only the skull of a young specimen,
such as was called <i>O. molossina</i> by Lesson and Garnet. I may
observe that I had shown in my first ‘Catalogue of Seals’ (1850),
from the examination of the typical skull, that two or three of
these nominal species were only very old or young skulls of the
southern Sea-lion.</p>

<p>It is the character of the Eared Seals or <i>Otariadæ</i> to have a very
close, soft under-fur between the roots of the longer and more rigid
hairs. They are therefore called <i>Fur-Seals</i> by the sealers, and are
hunted for their skin as well as for their oil. The quantity and
fineness of the under-fur differ in the various species; and the skin
and under-fur bear a price in the market according to the country
and the species from which they are obtained.</p>

<p>Some species of the family have so little under-fur when they
arrive at adult age, that they are of no value in the market to be
made into “seal-skins;” these are therefore called <i>Hair-Seals</i> by
the sealers. They are only collected for the oil, as the skins are of
comparatively little value.</p>

<p>The skins of the Fur-Seal are much used in China, and are more
or less the fashion in this country, sometimes being far more expensive
than at others. The skins of the Hair-Seals are only used, like
the skins of the Earless Seals or <i>Phocidæ</i>, for very inferior purposes,
as covering boxes, knapsacks, &amp;c.; but the animals are much sought
after for the oil they afford.</p>

<p>The furs of the different species of Fur-Seals are exceedingly different
in external appearance, especially in the younger specimens,
or when the fur is in its most perfect condition. In most species
the hairs are much longer than the under-fur; they are flat and
more or less rigid and crisp. In others the hairs are short, much
softer, scarcely longer than the soft woolly under-fur; in these species
the fur is very dense, standing nearly erect from the skin, forming
a very soft elastic coat, as in <i>O. falklandicus</i> and <i>O. Stelleri</i>.</p>

<p>The hair of <i>O. nigrescens</i> is considerably longer than that of <i>O. cinerea</i>,
but not so harsh, the fur of the half-grown <i>O. nigrescens</i> being
longer, sparse, flat, rather curled at the end, giving a crispness to
the feel; while the hairs of the very young specimens are abundant,
nearly of equal length, forming an even coat that is soft and smooth
to the touch.</p>

<p>The length, abundance, and, indeed, the presence or absence of
the under-fur greatly depend on the season at which the specimen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
is obtained or observed. It is true that the sealers call some seals
hair- and others fur-seals; but that is only because what they call
hair-seals never had more than a very small quantity of under-fur
in the fur-season; but, on the other hand, many fur-seals at some
seasons have only a small quantity of the under-fur which is so long
and abundant at other periods.</p>

<p>Difficult as it is for the zoologist to distinguish the species by their
external appearance, the skins of the different species of Fur-Seals
are easily distinguished by the dealers, even when they are wet,
showing that the practical fellmonger is in advance of the scientific
man in such particulars, as the dealers in whalebone were in regard
to the distinction of the species of the Whale by their baleen (see
Zool. Erebus &amp; Terror).</p>

<p>The longer hairs of the Fur-Seals are very slender and pale-coloured
at the basal half of their length, and thicker and darker at
the upper half, and often have a white tip. The basal half is subcylindrical,
the upper half is flat, tapering at each end. The absolute
length of the under-fur differs in the various species. Judging
from the old and young specimens of <i>A. nigrescens</i>, the hairs seem
to be longer, both absolutely and relatively to the under-fur, in the
young than in the adult animals. The hairs of the Hair-Seals are
shorter, flat, channelled above, and gradually tapering from the base
to the tip, merely contracted at the insertion into the skin. The
breadth of the hairs seems to vary in the different species; and in
the younger specimens there are to be observed some soft hairs like
the under-fur of the Fur-Seals.</p>

<p>The <i>Fur-Seals</i> are <i>Callorhinus ursinus</i>, <i>Arctocephalus antarcticus</i>,
<i>A. nigrescens</i>, <i>A. cinereus</i>, <i>A. Forsteri</i>, <i>A. falklandicus</i>, <i>Eumetopias
Stelleri</i>, <i>Arctophoca Philippii</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Hair-Seals</i> are <i>Otaria jubata</i>, <i>Phocarctos Hookeri</i>, <i>Arctocephalus
nivosus</i>, <i>Zalophus Gilliespii</i>, <i>Neophoca lobatus</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters, in his two papers on the Eared Seals (<i>Otaria</i>) uses the
length of the ears and the existence or non-existence of the under-fur,
as well as the characters used by Mr. Gill and myself, to separate
the species of these animals into subgenera.</p>

<p>The length of the ears may probably afford good characters for
the separation of the species and groups, if they can be observed in
the living animals. As yet, only one species of these animals, the
Sea-lion or Sea-bear (<i>Otaria leonina</i>), has been observed alive in
Europe; so that Dr. Peters’s notes could only be derived from the
examination of more or less carefully preserved skins; and, I fear,
little dependence can be placed on them.</p>

<p>The form of the hinder opening of the nostrils and the form of its
front edge, when only one or two skulls of a species were examined,
have been regarded as constituting a good character; but when an
extensive series of the skulls of a single species, or of several species,
have been examined, that part is found to vary considerably as to
the width of its different parts, and especially in the form of its
front edge. As far as my observations have extended, the hinder
opening of the nostrils appears to become narrower, and especially its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
front edge, as the animal becomes adult or aged; and in the skulls
of the younger specimens it is broader, shorter, and the front edge
is broader and more truncated or straight, with only a slight rounding
at the sides.</p>

<p>The position of the grinders as regards the front part of the zygomatic
arch is a good character for the distinction of the species,
especially if a series of skulls from animals of different ages, and
from the same locality, of each species are compared together; and
it is the same with the rooting of the grinders themselves. But
when adult skulls of different species are compared together, the
forms of the skulls are so altered, the grinders generally so worn
and altered by age, and their position in different species so similar,
that the distinction of the species then becomes more difficult.</p>

<p>The flap of thick bald skin produced beyond the hinder toes varies
in length as compared with the toes, in the length of it before it divides
into lobes, and the length of the lobes themselves in different
species, and thus affords characters for their separation;
but it is difficult to determine the proper length of it and its parts
from a preserved specimen in the Museum. It is apt to be unnaturally
stretched in length and width by the preparer, and it shrinks
as it dries long after it is placed in the Museum.</p>

<p>If I am not deceived by the prepared skins, the flap appears to
be longer in the adult than in the young specimens; and judging
from the specimens in the Museum, it is longest in <i>Callorhinus
ursinus</i>, and it gradually becomes shorter in <i>Arctocephalus antarcticus</i>,
<i>A. falklandicus</i>, <i>Phocarctos Hookeri</i>, <i>A. cinereus</i>, <i>Otaria jubata</i>, and
<i>A. nigrescens</i>. It is very short in <i>Neophoca lobata</i> and <i>Eumetopias
Stelleri</i>.</p>

<p>The “Prodrome of a Monograph of the Pinnipedes,” by Mr. Theodore
Gill, wherein he named several genera of this group, and a
paper by Dr. Peters on the <i>Otariæ</i> of the Berlin Museum, in the
‘Monatsbericht’ for May 1866, have induced me to reexamine the
skulls and skeletons in the British Museum.</p>

<p>I may observe that Dr. Peters considers all the Eared Seals one
genus, but has divided them into seven subgenera, to each of which
he gives a distinctive name. Dr. Peters’s paper is interesting as
determining the specimens described by Pander and D’Alton, Johann
Müller, and other German naturalists, as well as describing the
more recently received specimens in the Berlin Museum, which
certainly is one of the most important on the Continent.</p>

<p>Captain Thomas Musgrave, in a work entitled ‘Cast away on the
Aucklands,’ 12mo, 1866, pp. 141 and following, gives a very interesting
account of the habits and manners of the Lion-seal, showing
how unlike they are in their habits to the Seals without ears (Phocidæ).
The female brings forth her young far inland, and has to
teach them to take to the water which is to be their future home.</p>

<p>Captain Weddell gives nearly the same account of the habits of
the Fur-Seal, as does also Mr. Hamilton (in Ann. &amp; Mag. Nat.
Hist. 1839, p. 87).</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen, in the ‘Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Zoology’ at Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass., has published (1870)
an essay on the Eared Seals (Otariadæ), with detailed descriptions
of the North-Pacific species.</p>

<p>He divides the family into subfamilies:—</p>

<p>Subfam. 1. <i>Trichophocinæ</i>, without under-fur, and containing the
genera <span class="smcap">Otaria</span>, <span class="smcap">Eumetopias</span>, <span class="smcap">Zalophus</span>.</p>

<p>Subfam. 2. <i>Eulophocinæ</i>, with thick under-fur, containing <span class="smcap">Callorhinus</span>
and <span class="smcap">Arctocephalus</span>.</p>

<p>He gives figures of the skulls of different ages of the North-Pacific
species.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen had only the skins in salt and the bones of two
North-Pacific species to study, and he does not seem to be aware
that the abundance of the under-fur greatly depends on the season
and age of the animal when collected; and unfortunately he seems
to have had no specimens or skulls of the southern species to enable
him to study their characters; yet with these limited materials he
has ventured to propose a revision of the species of Otariadæ, and,
from the same cause, has suggested the uniting of many incongruous
species together. It may be very true that zoologists have erred
(myself among the number) in making too many genera and species;
but the correction of this error requires as much study and consideration
of the entire subject as have been used in their determination;
and science is not advanced by hasty alterations founded on a
few specimens.</p>

<p>The Eared Seals are collected for their oil and skins. Most of the
species have very dense under-fur of soft erect hairs between the
bases of the longer hairs. These are called “Fur-Seals;” and the
skins, when deprived of their long hairs, are very valuable. The
dressed furs of the various species and localities are of very different
commercial and economic value. The skins of <i>Neophoca lobata</i> (of
Australia) and <i>Phocarctos Hookeri</i> (of the Southern Ocean), being
nearly destitute of this under-fur, are called <i>Hair-Seals</i> by the
sealers. Their skins are of little comparative value, as they are only
used like the skins of the Earless Seals (Phocidæ).</p>

rather in front, on the line of the condyles. The teeth in the
younger skull are more lobed than in the adult; the upper grinders
are also differently disposed; the third upper grinder is under the
front edge of the orbit, and the fifth tooth is in a line with the back
edge of the zygomatic arch, and the last or sixth tooth is far behind
it (see skull, Cat. S. &amp; W. p. 58, f. 18). This change is remarkable,

<p>The oldest of the three adult skulls in the British Museum differs
from the other two in the pterygoid processes of the hinder edge of
the palate being closer together than in the rest; but this character
seems to depend on the greater age of the animal, as it differs slightly
in the other two specimens. In all the younger specimens, varying
greatly in size, the pterygoid processes are far apart.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters considers (1) <i>Platyrhynchus leoninus</i> of F. Cuvier, (2)
<i>Phoca Byronia</i> of Blainville, and (3) an adult specimen which is in
the Hamburg Museum, and of which he described and figured the
skull as <i>O. Godeffroyi</i>, to be distinct species. I cannot see any
difference between the skull in the College of Surgeons, on which
<i>Phoca Byronia</i> was founded, and those in the British Museum; and
the figure of the skull described as <i>O. Godeffroyi</i> is very similar to
the skull in the British-Museum collection which I have called
<i>O. jubata</i>.</p>

<p>This animal has the harsh fur without any under-fur of <i>Phocarctos
Hookeri</i>; but it entirely differs from that animal in the colour
of the fur. This cannot arise from the greater age of the animal, as
it is not nearly so large as the half-grown <i>P. Hookeri</i> in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>In the dark blackish-brown colour of the fur and the pale-brown
colour of the nape, and in the absence of the under-fur, this Seal
resembles the adult <i>Neophoca lobata</i> from Australia; but in that
species the pale colour extends all over the crown, while in the young
male <i>Otaria jubata</i> there are only a few paler scattered hairs on the
middle of the crown and nose.</p>

<p>Dr. Murie represents the skull of a nearly full-grown male and of
a female nearly of the same age (P. Z. S. 1869, p. 103. f. 1, 2).
They greatly differ, the nose and the palate being much wider in
the male than in the female, and the teeth in the male (but this
may be only an individual peculiarity) were much worn down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>He observes, “the whole of the palate is much narrower than in
the male of the same size, especially in the maxillary region, and
the teeth are much weaker and more sharply pointed.”</p>

<p>He observes, “The young of both sexes are alike of a dark brown
or very deep chocolate colour. The males about a year old retain
somewhat of the chocolate tint of their youth, which, however, is
paler, and subsequently changes annually as the coat is shed. The
females of equal age assume a dark grey hue dorsally, while the
abdominal parts are light yellowish. As they grow older they alter
little.</p>

<p>“Males a couple of years old or more become of a rich brown shade
on the back and sides, and lighter or yellowish beneath. Old males
alone are maned.</p>

<p>“There is a sparse underwool on the young, which sensibly diminishes
with age.</p>

<p>“The skulls of the adult male and female differ considerably, the
latter being comparatively the narrower of the two—the former possessing
a somewhat different form of teeth, besides proportionally
immense canines.</p>

<p>“The teeth of <i>Otaria jubata</i> are subject occasionally to a peculiar
wearing, of a median constricted character.</p>

<p>“Between the female and male of this species there is a wide
difference as regards the stretch of the pectoral flippers. In the
skin of the male the breadth from tip to tip of the fore flippers is
equal to or greater than the length of the body; in the female the
reverse obtains. This fact points to greater strength and swimming-power
of the former.”</p>

<p>Inhab. Falkland Islands and Cape Horn.</p>

<p>Pennant, in his ‘Quadrupeds,’ describes an Eared Seal, rather
more than 2 feet long, the whole body of which was covered with
longish hair of a whitish or cream-colour; it was brought from the
Straits of Magellan, and preserved in Parkinson’s Museum on the
south side of Blackfriar’s Bridge (see “Eared Seal,” Pennant’s
Quad. ii. p. 278). Dr. Shaw, in his ‘General Zoology,’ gave the
name of <i>Phoca flavescens</i> to this species, and figured it (i. p. 260,
t. 73).</p>

<p>This is very probably the young of the Hair-Seal of the Falklands,
described by me as <i>Arctocephalus Hookeri</i>, which is of a pale-yellowish
colour. Pennant does not mention the want of the
under-fur.</p>

<p>Dr. Burmeister observes:—“We have in the Museum [at Buenos
Ayres] a young half-grown specimen [of <i>Arctocephalus falklandicus</i>]
nearly 3 feet long. From this I have taken the skull, of which I
send you a description and drawings” (Ann. N. H. 1866, xviii.
p. 99, t. 9. f. 1, 2, 3, 4). From the comparison of the figures, and
especially of the teeth and the form of the palate, with our older
skull of <i>Arctocephalus Hookeri</i>, I have little doubt that it is the
skull of a specimen of that species before the grinders were all developed.
It is not the skull of <i>Otaria jubata</i>, which the other specimen
he called <i>A. falklandicus</i> is, as proved by the form and
position of the hinder nasal openings. The figure of the young
skull differs from the older skull of <i>A. Hookeri</i> in the British Museum
in having a notch in the middle, while the older skull of <i>A.
Hookeri</i> has a conical prominence in the same place. Such differences
are found in skulls of Seals at different ages.</p>

<p>The skull of the young animal described and figured by Dr. Burmeister
as <i>Arctocephalus falklandicus</i> (Ann. &amp; Mag. N. H. 1866,
xviii. p. 99, t. 9. f. 1 &amp; 2), is probably the young skull of this
species. It agrees with it in the elongated form of the skull, and
in the large size and great development of the processes of the
orbits.</p>

<p>Dr. Murie regards <i>Otaria Philippii</i> as founded on the skull of
this species (P. Z. S. 1869, p. 108).</p>

<p>Mr. Allen, on the contrary, includes <i>Otaria Hookeri</i> as a synonym
of <i>Otaria jubata</i>. One could not have a better proof of the want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>

<p>The two adult skulls in the British Museum differ greatly in the
width of the hinder nasal opening, in the form of the hinder lower
lateral processes of the occipital bone, in the form of the back of
that bone, and in the shape of the condyles.</p>

<p>The skull from the Cape of Good Hope, in the Museum of
the University of Edinburgh, was described and figured by Dr.
Turner under the name of <i>Arctocephalus schisthyperoës</i>, in the
‘Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,’ vol. iii. p. 113. The name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
is changed to <i>A. schistuperus</i> by Dr. Günther in the ‘Zoological
Record’ for 1868, p. 20. It is evidently the skull of a half-grown
animal, with all its teeth developed, but with the sutures of the
bones still apparent. It agrees in every respect with what I
should expect to be the form and structure of the skull of <i>Arctocephalus
antarcticus</i> from the Cape; but unfortunately the two
skulls of that Sea-bear from the Cape which are in the British
Museum are from old animals; and the specimen figured by Cuvier,
Oss. Foss. v. 220, t. 18. f. 5, is also adult. It differs from the skulls
of the two adult specimens of that species in the British Museum
in the hinder nasal aperture being much extended forwards and
gradually tapering to a point in front, which reaches to the transverse
palato-maxillary suture. This peculiarity in the form of the
palate, which Prof. Turner has not observed in any other seal-skull,
seems to have induced him to regard it as a distinct species.
From the examination I have made of the skulls of Seals in the
Museum and other collections, I am induced to believe that it
is an individual abnormality of <i>Arctocephalus antarcticus</i>. I have
observed a similar malformation in the palates of two other species.
I was myself misled by their structure, before I met with the
other examples, to regard a skull with such a deformity as a distinct
species.</p>

<p>At one time I thought that it might be a peculiarity of the
young state, as it had up to that time only been observed in
skulls of half-grown animals. It occurs in half-grown specimens
of <i>Euotaria nigrescens</i>; but the skulls of the very young specimens
of this Seal in the British Museum have the front edge
of the hinder nasal opening truncated and slightly arched in form,
with well-developed square palatine bones united by a central suture
just as in the adult, but broader and straighter.</p>

<p>It was this observation that induced me to return to my original
opinion, that the skull which I had at first regarded as a young
skull of <i>Arctocephalus monteriensis</i> (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1859), and
then as a separate species under the name of <i>A. californianus</i>
(Cat. Seals and Whales, p. 51), was only a monstrosity of <i>A.
monteriensis</i>, as I did in the Ann. &amp; Mag. Nat. Hist. 1866, xviii.
p. 232; and I am now induced to believe that <i>Arctocephalus
schisthyperoës</i> is only an imperfectly developed skull of <i>A. antarctica</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. J. R. Forster, in Cook’s voyage in 1775, observed the Eared
Seal at the Cape of Good Hope, and called it <i>Phoca ursina</i>. Believing
it to be the same as the Sea-bear he had observed in New
Zealand, Thunberg, in his list of Cape Mammalia in the third
volume of the ‘Transactions of the St. Petersburg Academy,’ iii.
322, notices this animal under the name of <i>Phoca antarctica</i> (see
Fischer, Syn. Mam. p. 242). Dr. Peters has applied the name of
<i>Otaria pusilla</i> to this species, believing it to be the <i>Petit Phoque</i> of
Buffon, which has been named <i>Phoca pusilla</i> by Schreber, and had
before been named <i>Phoca parva</i> by Boddaert. Buffon says that it
came either from India or the Levant; but it is not by its description<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
to be distinguished from a young specimen of almost any of
the species. It is as likely to have come from the Falkland Islands
as from the Cape, as the French had traffic with Les Iles Malouines,
as they call them.</p>

<p>M. de Buffon describes a small Eared Seal, which he calls a
“second Phoque” (vol. xiii. p. 341, t. 43, where it is named “le
petit Phoque”), which, he was assured, came from India, but very
probably came from the Levant; and he considers it adult, because
it has all its teeth. It is only one-fifth of the size of the
Seal of the European seas (Hist. Nat. xiii. p. 344). He further
speaks of it as “le petit Phoque noir des Indes et du Levant”
(p. 345). It is evidently a young Eared Seal. The figure is probably
from the skin, with the bones of the toes and jaws, presented
to the cabinet by M. Mauduit (mentioned at p. 433. n. 1273),
and said to have come from India.</p>

<p>The specimen Buffon figured, then being in the Paris Museum, was
thus described by Cuvier (Oss. Foss. v. p. 220):—“Cet animal a deux
pieds de long; ses oreilles sont grandes et pointues; son pelage est
fourré, luisant, d’un brun noir très-foncé et a sa nuance blanchâtre.
Le ventre seul est brun-jaunâtre.” The teeth show that it is young.</p>

<p>The figure and description of the <i>Petit Phoque</i> of Buffon have had
the following names given to them:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Little Seal, <i>by Pennant and Shaw</i>.</li>
<li>Phoca pusilla, <i>Schreber</i>, <i>Säugeth</i>. 314 (<i>Peters</i>).</li>
<li>Phoca parva, <i>Bodd. Elench.</i> 78.</li>
<li>Otaria pusilla, <i>Desm. N. Dict.</i></li>
<li>Otaria Peronii, <i>Desm. Mamm.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Fischer, in his ‘Synopsis,’ under <i>Phoca pusilla</i>, p. 252, gives the
Cape of Good Hope and Rotteness Island, on the coast of Australia,
as the habitat of the species.</p>

<p>The description of Cuvier much more nearly fits that of the
young <i>Arctocephalus nigrescens</i> from the Falkland Islands. The
fur of the young Cape Seal is dark, black above and below; the
hairs are slender, and brown (not whitish) at the base; and the
underside is not yellowish brown; so that it is very doubtful if it
is the young of the Cape Seal.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters, believing Buffon’s specimen to be a young Cape Seal,
changed the name of <i>Delalandii</i> to <i>pusilla</i>.</p>

<p>In the Museum are three states in flat skins:—</p>

<p>1. Adult male, with slight mane, called in the sale-catalogue
“large-wig.” Fur whitish, with a few intermixed black hairs;
under-fur short, reddish. B.M.</p>

<p>2. Adult, without the mane, called in the sale-catalogue “middling.”
Fur reddish white, grizzled with scattered black hairs;
underside of the body darker, reddish brown; under-fur short,
reddish. B.M.</p>

<p>3. Young, about 18 inches long, called in the sale-catalogue
“black pup,” from the Cape of Good Hope. Fur black, polished,
soft, smooth, without any grey tips, rather browner black beneath;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
under-fur brown, very sparse; hairs slender, polished,
black, with very slender brown bases. B.M.</p>

<p>Inhab. Falkland Islands, Volunteer Rock (<i>Capt. Abbott</i>).</p>

<p>The two skulls of this species in the British Museum agree in
most particulars; but they differ considerably in the form of the
hinder nostrils. The larger one is without its upper teeth, but the
forms of the roots are well exhibited by their sockets; the front
edge of the hinder nasal opening is produced rather further forward,
and is acutely angular. The other skull, which is rather
smaller and has the teeth in good condition, has the hinder nasal
opening with a slightly arched, nearly truncated, front edge.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters refers <i>Phoca falklandica</i> (Shaw, Zool. i. p. 256) and
<i>Otaria falklandica</i>. (Hamilton, Ann. &amp; Mag. N. H. 1839, p. 81,
t. 4; Jardine, Nat. Lib. vi. p. 271, t. 25) to this species. But as
neither Dr. Shaw nor Dr. Hamilton describes the number or position
of the teeth, it is not possible to determine if this is the <i>Fur-Seal</i>
of the sealers, collected at the Falkland Islands, more especially
as the fact of the skull coming from the Falkland Islands is
not well ascertained. See the other synonyma which have been
established on the sealers’ descriptions and figures or the skins
collected for the furriers at the Falkland Islands (Gray, Cat. Seals
and Whales, pp. 55, 56). Dr. Hamilton, who prides himself on his
figure, represents the hind legs as extended behind: but they look
very awkward in that position, the stuffer having evidently had a
difficulty in extending them.</p>

<p>The hair of <i>A. nigrescens</i> is considerably longer than that of <i>A.
cinereus</i>, but not so harsh, the fur of the half-grown <i>A. nigrescens</i>
being longer, sparse, flat, rather curled at the end, giving it a crispness
to the feel; while the hairs of the very young specimens are
abundant, nearly of equal length, forming an even coat that is soft
and smooth to the touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>Capt. Abbott’s young specimen in the British Museum chiefly
differs from the adult specimen in the same collection in the hairs
being longer, more erect, and with minute white tips, and in the
face, throat, and chest being rufous brown; but this reddish colour
is common to the young of several Sea-bears.</p>

<p>The skulls from Desolation Island, on the south-west coast of
Patagonia, presented to the Anatomical Museum of the University
of Edinburgh by the late Professor Goodsir, evidently belong to
<i>Euotaria nigrescens</i>, the usual Fur-Seal of the Falkland Islands and
other parts of the coast of South-west America. Two of the
skulls are from adult animals, are without the lower jaws, and
have only a few worn and broken teeth, having been rolled on the
beach.</p>

<p>The other skull is of a young animal, exactly similar to the skull
of a young <i>Euotaria nigrescens</i>, n. 1013<i>e</i>, in the British-Museum
collection. The front edge of the hinder nostrils is as arched as in
that specimen; the teeth are rather more developed than in our
skull; they have a well-marked central lobe and a distinct small
acute tubercle on the front edge of the cingulum.</p>

<p>The two adult skulls are very like the adult skull of <i>E. nigrescens</i>,
1013<i>d</i>, in the British Museum; but the opening of the internal
nostrils is narrower, and their front edge in one is not nearly so
angular, and in the other it is rather more arched than in either
of the other two skulls, showing that the size of the posterior
nasal aperture and the form of its front edge vary in different
specimens of this species.</p>

<p>The comparison of the young skull with the more adult one
shows that the grinders change their position considerably as regards
the front edge of the hinder nasal opening. In the young
skull of <i>Euotaria nigrescens</i> the hinder end of the tooth-line is very
near (not a quarter of an inch from) a line level with the front
edge of the internal nasal opening, and the hinder part of the palate
in front of the aperture is nearly as broad as the middle of the
palate: in the adult skull the hinder end of the tooth-line is a full
inch from the front edge of the internal nasal opening, the hinder
part of the palate is contracted toward the internal nostril, and the
internal nasal opening is lengthened and narrowed; but the real
position of the teeth, as compared with the front part of the zygomatic
arch, is little altered, though the form of the palate gives
them the appearance of being more changed than they really are.</p>

<p>These skulls are interesting as showing that <i>Euotaria nigrescens</i>,
like <i>Otaria leonina</i> and <i>Morunga elephantina</i>, is, or was, common
to the Falkland Islands and the west coast of South America.</p>

<p>The chief character by which the adult skull of <i>Euotaria nigrescens</i>
can be distinguished from the adult skull of <i>Arctocephalus
antarcticus</i> is, that the hinder or fifth upper grinder and the penultimate
or fourth are placed rather in front of the hinder edge of
the front part of the zygomatic arch; but the position of the teeth is
most distinctive in the skull of the young animal, and loses much
of its importance in comparing old skulls together, unless the skulls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
and teeth are very accurately compared; and even then the distinction
is more imaginary than real.</p>

<p>I cannot understand Capt. Abbott’s account of this species. He
says that “the full-grown Seal is about the size of the common
English Seal. The largest skin I have ever seen I do not think measured
more than 4 feet in length, perhaps hardly so much. The hair
differs in colour, being sometimes grey, and at other times of a
brownish tint; that of the young is of a darker brown colour.”
All this agrees better with the true <i>O. falklandica</i>; but yet he says
the skin of his half-grown specimen is now in the British Museum,
and that skin is undoubtedly <i>Euotaria nigrescens</i>. Has Mr. Abbott
confounded the two species in his mind? Or did he forget the
animal? for he informed me that there were no Sea-elephants now
living on the island. (P. Z. S. 1868, p. 190.)</p>

<p>“The bones of the pectoral limb of the Fur-Seal of commerce differ
from those of the Sea-lion.”—<i>Murie</i>, P. Z. S. 1869, p. 109.</p>

<p>See Lecomte’s account of the habits of these animals, P. Z. S.
1869, p. 106.</p>

<p>The British Museum contains the skin and skull of a large
blackish Eared Seal, nearly 6 feet long, that was purchased of a
dealer as “a Fur-Seal from the Falkland Islands;” but, as the
dealers seem always to give that as the habitat for all seal-skins
with a distinct under-coat that come into their possession, I have
quoted the habitat with doubt. When occupied in describing the
Seals of the southern hemisphere for the ‘Voyage of the Erebus
and Terror,’ I named the Seal <i>Arctocephalus nigrescens</i>, and had the
skull figured under that name; but the plate has not yet been published,
though copies of it have been given to Dr. Peters and other
zoologists. In the ‘Proceedings of the Zoological Society’ for
1859, pp. 109, 360, and in the ‘Catalogue of Seals and Whales,’
I described the skull of this species. There is also in the Museum
a skull of a younger animal of the same species.</p>

<p>Capt. Abbott, in 1866, sent to the British Museum a large and a
small Seal from the Falkland Islands. The large one was examined
and determined to be the southern Sea-lion (<i>Otaria jubata</i>). The
small one, nearly 3 feet long, was very similar in external appearance;
and as the teeth, which could be seen without extracting the
skull, showed that it was a young animal, it was regarded as the
young of the Sea-lion, and it was stuffed without extracting the
skull, and labelled as such. This specimen has been examined by
several zoologists, among the rest by Dr. Peters, when engaged with
his paper on Eared Seals, and has passed unchallenged until this
time, thus showing how difficult it is to distinguish these animals
by their external characters alone.</p>

<p>Capt. Abbott, who is now residing in England, informed me that
the smaller specimen was the Fur-Seal of the Falkland Islands,
that it grows to about half as long again as the specimen sent, and
that the old males are grey from the tips of the hairs. I have
therefore had the skull extracted from the specimen; and there is
no doubt that it is quite distinct from the Sea-lion (<i>Otaria jubata</i>);<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and, on more careful examination of the skin, I have little doubt,
from the colour and the character of the fur, that it is a young specimen
of the Seal that I described as <i>Arctocephalus nigrescens</i>. It
is interesting as confirming the accuracy of the habitat that I received
with that specimen, and which until this time I considered doubtful,
as Pennant and others describe the Falkland Island Fur-Seal
as grey, and white beneath.</p>

<p>Dr. Peters, on the authority of this habitat (which I have always
quoted with doubt), has given the name of <i>Arctophoca falklandica</i>
to the animal and skull on which I had established my <i>Arctocephalus
nigrescens</i>.</p>

<p>In the British Museum there is the skin of a very young Seal,
which was presented by Sir John Richardson as the Falkland
Island Fur-Seal, with the observation appended that the adult is
5 feet long, and its skin is worth fifteen dollars. It is without its
skull. The fur of this young Seal is dark brown, reddish beneath,
and very like that of the young specimen sent by Capt. Abbott; but
the hairs are smoother, and the white tips to them are longer and
more marked, giving the animal a more grizzled appearance.</p>

<p>There is another young Eared Seal, very like the former, which
was received with General Hardwicke’s Collection (who, no doubt,
purchased it of a dealer), said to have come from the Cape of Good
Hope. I suspect this habitat must be erroneous; for it is very unlike
what I recollect of the young Cape Eared Seals, which are
called “Black Dogs,” on account of the blackness of their colour.
Unfortunately we have no specimen of the latter in the Museum
collection. General Hardwicke’s specimen only differs from Sir
John Richardson’s in being less punctulated with white; fewer
hairs have a white tip, and the tip is shorter.</p>

<p>Both these young specimens differ from the half-grown one obtained
from Capt. Abbott, in the fur being softer and smooth to the touch;
and Capt. Abbott’s specimen differs from the adult in the length and
greater crispness of its fur, the fur of the old one being harsh and
hard and closer pressed.</p>

<p>In the first essay, Dr. Peters places <i>Phoca falklandica</i>, Shaw,
and <i>Otaria nigrescens</i> together, with doubt, observing that one was
known from the skin, and the other by the skull, overlooking the
fact that the name <i>nigrescens</i> implied that I had seen the colour of
the fur, which was not that given by Shaw to his animal; in his
second essay, Dr. Shaw’s, Dr. Burmeister’s, and my animal are all
classed together without any doubt.</p>

<p>The skull of Capt. Abbott’s Fur-Seal from the Falkland Islands
shows that it was a very young animal, which had only developed its
first grinders, the permanent series being developed below them.
The tentorium is bony and well developed. The teeth are the same
in position and number as they are in the adult skull; and the
upper ones, as far as developed, are small and conical, except the
fifth upper grinder, which is largest, triangular, with a single subconical
lobe on the base of the hinder edge of the cone. The lower
canines are small, scarcely larger than the cutting-teeth, which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
nearly uniform in size. The lower grinders are of a much larger
size than the upper ones in the adult skull, as if they belonged to
the permanent series: they are of the same form as the teeth in
adult skulls; but the central cone is higher and more acute, and the
anterior and posterior lobes at the base of the cone are more developed
and acute, the lobes of the last or fifth grinder being larger
and rather on the inner surface of the tooth.</p>

<p>The skull of Capt. Abbott’s animal is evidently not the same as
the skull of a young Eared Seal described and figured by Dr. Burmeister
as the skull of <i>Arctocephalus falklandicus</i> from the mouth
of the Rio de la Plata, in the Ann. &amp; Mag. Nat. Hist. ser. 3, vol.
xviii. p. 99, t. 9, which, from the appearance of the grinders, I
suspect is the young skull of <i>Phocarctos Hookeri</i>, the Hair-Seal of
the Falkland Islands. There is a considerable difference in the
proportions of the skull sent by Capt. Abbott from those of the one
figured by Dr. Burmeister. In Capt. Abbott’s specimen the brain-case,
from the back edge of the orbit to the occiput, is as long as the
length of the face, from the same edge of the orbit to the end of the
nose. In Dr. Burmeister’s figure, the face from the same point
is much longer than the brain-case.</p>

<p>There are the stuffed skin, with its skull, and the bones of the
face of another young specimen of this Seal in the British Museum,
collected in the Australasian Sea by Mr. John Macgillivray.</p>

<p>According to the observations of Dr. Peters, founded on the examination
of the typical skulls, <i>Otaria ursina</i> of Nilsson and <i>Otaria
Lemarii</i> of J. Müller (Arch. f. Naturg. 1841, p. 334) include the
<i>Arctocephalus antarcticus</i> from South Africa and <i>A. cinereus</i> of Australia.</p>

<p><i>Otaria Stelleri</i> of Schlegel (Fauna Japonica, t. 22. f. 55) includes
both the Australian Eared Seals, viz. <i>Arctocephalus cinereus</i> and
<i>Neophoca lobata</i>; and it is quite distinct from the <i>Otaria Stelleri</i> of
Lesson and T. Müller, which is a combination of the Sea-bear and
Sea-lion of Steller (that is to say, <i>Eumetopias Stelleri</i> and <i>Callorhinus
ursinus</i>).</p>

<p>The males of these animals are described as twice as long and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
broad (that is, four times as large) as the females. This may explain
the difference in size of the skulls from the same localities.</p>

<p>The fur changes its colour as the animal grows, the young being
generally black; and the adult males and females also differ considerably
in the colour of the fur.</p>

<p>The skulls of the following species are not known:—</p>

<h6>4. Arctocephalus Forsteri.</h6>

<p>Grinders 6/5·6/5, conical.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

</div>

<p>Inhab. Cloudy Bay, New Zealand.</p>

<p>This animal is only known from Dr. Forster’s description and
figure.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen observes, “I can see no evidence of the New-Zealand
Fur-Seal (of Forster) being specifically distinct from the Fur-Seal
of Australia, <i>A. cinereus</i> (auct.).”—<i>Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool.</i> ii.
p. 15.</p>

<p>At the same time Mr. Allen ventures to remark, “perhaps the <i>A.
cinereus</i> and the <i>A. antarcticus</i> are to be referred to the <i>A. falklandicus</i>,
in which case the habitat of this species is the southern seas
generally” (Bull. Comp. Zool. ii. p. 45): but he does not seem to
have had specimens of any of the three species; otherwise I do not
think he would have ventured upon the observation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, having no skull or other parts of the Lion Seal of
the Auckland Islands (the most southern of the New-Zealand group),
we are not able to determine whether it is the same species as
the Sea-lion of the southern end of the American continent (<i>Otaria
jubata</i>), or whether it is the Sea-lion of the southern end of the
African continent (<i>Arctocephalus antarcticus</i>), or the Sea-lion of the
Northern Australian Seas (<i>Neophoca lobata</i>).</p>

<p>Inhab. Falkland Islands (<i>Abbott</i>; <i>B.M.</i>); New Georgia.</p>

<p>This is a most distinct species, and easily known from all the other
Fur-Seals in the British Museum by the evenness, shortness, closeness,
and elasticity of the fur, and the length of the under-fur. The
fur is soft enough to wear as a rich fur without the removal of the
longer hairs, which are always removed in the other Fur-Seals.
Unfortunately the specimen is without any skull; and therefore I
cannot give a description of the teeth, or refer it to any of the restricted
genera of <i>Otariadæ</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Hamilton, in the ‘Annals of Natural History’ for 1838, ii.
p. 81, t. 4, gives the history of the Fur-Seals of commerce and the
method of catching them; and he deposited two specimens in the
Museum of Edinburgh, which had been procured by Capt. Weddel.
Mr. Abbott having informed me that what I had described under the
name of <i>Arctocephalus falklandicus</i> is not now found in the Falkland
Islands, and Mr. Bartlett having shown me an imperfect skin of the
same species, which he had obtained from a fur-monger, who informed
him that such fur-skins were only received from the Arctic
part of the Pacific Ocean, I was induced to request Mr. Archer,
director of the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art, to allow me
to examine the Seals described by Mr. Hamilton, which, on examination,
proved to be my <i>Arctocephalus falklandicus</i>, only differing
from the Museum specimen in the fur being considerably darker and
harsher; and, from Capt. Weddel’s account as given in the ‘Annals,’
these specimens came from South Georgia or South Shetland. These
Seals, which were brought from the Antarctic Ocean, may formerly
have inhabited the Falkland Islands, and, like the Sea-lion found
there by Pernetty, have been destroyed or driven away. <i>Arctocephalus
Hookeri</i> is said to be now found in the Antarctic Ocean and
the Falkland Islands. In that case it may be the Falkland-Island
Seal of Pennant.</p>

<p>The <i>A. falklandicus</i> is very like the Fur-Seal from Australia (<i>H.
cinereus</i>) in the length of the under-fur as compared with the length
of the hairs, and also in the colour of the under-fur and hair; but
the fur is much softer, and its general colour is much darker, both
above and below.</p>

<p>Pennant describes the “Falkland-Island Seal” from a specimen
4 feet long, in the museum of the Royal Society, thus:—“Hair short,
cinereous, tipped with dirty white;” “grinders conoid, with a small
process on one side near the base.” It is to this description that Dr.
Shaw applied the name of <i>Phoca falklandica</i> (Gen. Zool. i. p. 256).
This agrees with a specimen in the Museum in all particulars. It
certainly is not the dark blackish-brown Seal which I have described<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
as the <i>Arctocephalus nigrescens</i>, and which Dr. Peters calls <i>O. falklandica</i>.</p>

<p>I sent a piece of the fur of this Seal to Dr. Peters to be compared
with the fur of <i>O. Philippii</i>. He observes, “They appear to be
quite different; the wool of <i>O. falklandica</i> is fair and has more
similarity in colour to the young of <i>O. cinerea</i>. The wool of <i>O.
Philippii</i> is entirely ferruginous red, and the longer hairs are stiffer
and have a much shorter grey tip than in <i>O. falklandica</i>.”</p>

<h6>6. Arctocephalus? nivosus. <i>Cape Hair-Seal.</i></h6>

<p class="right">B.M.</p>

<p>Fur very short, close-pressed, black, varied with close, small,
often confluent, white spots; underside of the neck with a few
scattered white hairs; belly red-brown (nearly bay); hairs short,
thick, of one colour to the base; under-fur none, except a very few
hairs on the crown of the head. Skull unknown.</p>

<p>Inhab. Cape of Good Hope. B.M.</p>

<p>Length of skin nearly 8 feet; but stretched and flattened.</p>

<p>Dr. Murie (P. Z. S. 1869, p. 108) says that this is only a variety,
seasonal, sexual, or of a different age from the specimens hitherto
obtained.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen adopts this view, never having seen the specimen, but
changes the phrase into “a previously known species” (Bull. Mus.
Comp. Zool. ii. p. 18); but neither of them mentions the species to
which he refers it.</p>

<p>But surely Mr. Allen does not mean that it is only a variety of
the skins which were received with it from the Cape of Good Hope;
for, if that were the case, the species would belong to one of his subfamilies,
and the variety to the other.</p>

<p>In the form and length of the hair it is very different from <i>Arctocephalus
antarcticus</i>; and it is almost destitute of under-fur, except
on the crown of the head.</p>

<h4>Tribe IV. <i>ZALOPHINA.</i></h4>

<p>Grinders 5/5·5/5, large, thick, in a close continuous series; the fifth
upper in front of the back edge of the zygomatic arch.</p>

<p>In the younger skull the grinders are placed rather further back,
the hinder part of the upper grinder being behind the back edge of
the zygomatic arch. The grinders all single-rooted, as the last or
sixth grinder in each jaw, which is generally two-rooted, is absent.
The face of the skull is considerably produced, and the forehead is
flat.</p>

<p>The upper grinders all single-rooted, the root of the last two (the
fourth and fifth) being rather compressed, with an obscure central
longitudinal groove on the inner side; the first two grinders of the
lower jaw with oblong, the last three with compressed roots, and the
fourth and fifth with a slight longitudinal groove on the side.</p>

<p>In the younger skulls the roots of the grinders are more oblong,
less compressed, and do not show the lateral grooves, as far as the
teeth can be seen without being drawn from the sockets. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
front part of the younger skull, which was received from Mr. Gould,
the teeth are placed rather further back than in the adult skull from
North Australia received from Capt. Grey, the hinder part of the

<p>Fur without any under-fur. Palate flattish or rather concave in
front, as wide in front as at the end of the tooth-line, and then
slightly narrowed behind. Posterior nares oblong, elongate, broadly
truncated in front, the front edge being behind the line of the orbital
process of the zygomatic arch. The grinders have large oblong
roots; the second, third, and fourth upper ones have a subcentral
longitudinal groove on the outer side, and a less marked one on their
inner surface; the inner side of all but the first of the lower ones
are similarly grooved; the fifth upper grinder (or, more properly, the
sixth in the normal series) has two distinct roots. The lower jaw
much more elongate than that of <i>Otaria jubata</i>, the hinder angle
more oblique, and the lower margin long and straight. Flap of toes
short.</p>

<p>The skull of the young animal, which was sent by Mr. A. S.
Taylor to Mr. Gurney from California, and which I first described,
with doubt, as <i>Arctocephalus monteriensis</i>, junior (P. Z. S. 1859,
p. 357), and which in the ‘Catalogue of Seals and Whales’ I named
<i>A. californianus</i> (see p. 51), agrees in every respect in its dentition
with the large skull which we received from California, and which
I described and figured as <i>A. monteriensis</i> (P. Z. S. 1859, p. 358,
t. 72); but it differs greatly in the form of the hinder nares, which
are extended much more forwards, so that the front end, which is
very narrow and acute, is much in front of the prominence of the
orbit of the zygomatic arch, being, in fact, about in a line with the
middle of the lower edge of the orbital cavity.</p>

<p>This skull is evidently that of a very young animal; for the bones
are separate; but it has the same number and disposition of the teeth
as the large skull. There is the same wide space between the fourth
and fifth upper grinders; but there is at the back edge of the fourth
grinder, on the right side of the skull, a small pit, from which, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
doubt, a small rudimentary tooth has fallen out; and there is a much
wider but shallow pit on the other side, which may have been produced
by the loss of a rudimentary tooth; the last upper grinder
has a large swollen undivided root. If this is a young skull of
<i>Eumetopias monteriensis</i>, that species is curious for having the teeth
in the old and young skulls in the same situation as regards the
bones of the face.</p>

<p>The adult skull and the young one were from the same locality,
and, I believe, collected by the same person; and this being the
case, I am inclined to regard them as the same, only showing a
curious peculiarity in the growth of the animal, and also showing
that the form and position of the hinder nostril probably varies as
the animal increases in age.</p>

<p>Mr. Gill considers Steller’s Sea-bear (<i>Callorhinus ursinus</i>) to be
the type of M. F. Cuvier’s genus <i>Arctocephalus</i>, and therefore abolishes
<i>Callorhinus</i> and gives the new name of <i>Halarctus</i> to the true
<i>Arctocephali</i>—thus unnecessarily adding to the confusion of the
generic names of these animals. He fell into this mistake by not
observing that <i>Phoca ursina</i>, and even <i>Otaria ursina</i>, had been
applied to several species from very different localities, that F.
Cuvier established his genus on the skull of <i>P. ursina</i> of Forster,
from the Cape, which he (M. Cuvier) had named <i>Phoca Delalandii</i>,
and that F. Cuvier does not figure a skull of the Sea-bear of Steller:
indeed the French collection did not at that time, nor does it even
now, possess one; and I feel assured that, if it had, F. Cuvier would,
according to his custom, have established for it a genus distinct from
<i>Arctocephalus</i>, the skulls of the two genera being of such distinct
forms.</p>

<p>The skin of the young specimen which Mr. Gurney gave to the
Museum along with what was said by Mr. Taylor to be its skull
(see ‘Cat. Seals &amp; Whales,’ p. 51) was the only skin then known to
exist in museums; and consequently I described the fur of the genus
from this skin as having abundant under-fur (see Proc. Zool. Soc.
1859, p. 358). Dr. Peters having discovered Pander and D’Alton’s
animal and skull in the Paris Museum, he observed that the adult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
animal was entirely without under-fur—a fact which has been confirmed
by Mr. Allen, who suggests that the skin of the young received
from Monterey is the skin of the young <i>Eumetopias Stelleri</i>,
which, I think, is very probable. But this only shows the difficulties
that must occur in the study of animals from the very imperfect materials
which until lately existed.</p>

<p>The Sea-lion of Steller has been one of the zoological paradoxes.
Professor Nilsson, like most preceding authors, regarded it as a variety
of the <i>Otaria jubata</i>; and therefore I supposed it might be a
second species of the restricted genus <i>Otaria</i>. Dr. Peters has solved
the enigma by uniting it and the Seal which I described from California,
observing that the skull in the Berlin Museum, figured by
D’Alton under the name of “Steller’s Sea-lion” (<i>Phoca jubata</i>), was
received from Kamtschatka, and a second skull of an old male in the
Berlin Museum was received from Mr. Brandt as coming from
Behring’s Straits.</p>

<p>The figure of Pander and D’Alton is so imperfect that it would
have been impossible to determine the species it represents without
the examination of the original skull; and then one sees that it
may have been intended for the species to which it is referred. The
same observation is applicable to the figure of the skull of Steller’s
Sea-bear.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that these skulls escaped the researches of
Professor Nilsson, who visited most museums in Europe to examine
the typical specimens.</p>

<p>The specimen of <i>Callorhinus ursinus</i> now in the Museum was received
from St. Petersburg as <i>Otaria leonina</i>, or <i>Leo marinus</i> of
Steller, from Behring’s Straits; so they evidently confound two
species under that name.</p>

<h5>8. ARCTOPHOCA.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Arctophoca, <i>Peters</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Peters described this subgenus from a specimen sent from
Chili by Dr. Philippi. It chiefly differs from <i>Zalophus</i> in the palate
being much narrower, but rather wider behind, and the teeth rather
far apart. I have not seen any skull agreeing with these characters.</p>

<p>“With abundant under-fur.”</p>

<p>According to figures, the form of the skull and the large size of
the orbit are very similar to those of <i>Phocarctos Hookeri</i>, but the
number and form of the teeth are different.</p>

<p>In the ‘Monatsbericht,’ May 1866, p. 276, t. 2. <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, Dr.
Peters described and figured with considerable detail a skull of a
Sea-bear (sent to the Berlin Museum by Dr. Philippi, who obtained
it at Juan Fernandez Island) under the name of <i>Otaria Philippi</i>,
forming for it a subgenus which he calls <i>Arctophoca</i>. In his revision
of that paper, published in the same work for November 1866,
p. 671, he places it as a synonym or subspecies of what he calls
<i>Otaria falklandica</i>, which is my <i>Arctocephalus nigrescens</i>, and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the <i>Otaria falklandica</i> of Shaw nor the <i>O. falklandica</i> of Burmeister
as Dr. Peters supposes, as I have shown above. In this paper he
removes <i>Otaria falklandica</i> (that is, <i>nigrescens</i>) from the subgenus
<i>Phocarctos</i>, to which he referred it in his first paper, and places it in
his subgenus <i>Arctophoca</i>.</p>

<p>Inhab. Juan Fernandez Island (<i>Philippi</i>; in Mus. Berl.).</p>

<p>Above black-grey, more greyish yellow on the head and neck,
brownish black <i>beneath</i>; the base of the limbs of a rusty brown,
shining; lips and lower jaw principally rusty brown; hair of beard
in six rows, partly black, partly quite white, partly black with
white base. The outbristling (prominent bristly) pointed hairs are
rusty brown at the base, black at the end, on the back mostly with
very short rusty-yellowish points, and on the head and neck with
somewhat longer ones. On the sides of the belly the ends of the coarser
pointed hairs are either uniformly brownish black, or are very short
rusty-red ones. The thick under-hair is rusty red. The hairs on
the upper surface of the neck are 22 millims. long; those on the
middle of the back 18, and those on the middle of the belly 11 to
12. The dense short hair on the back of the hand extends only to
the <i>middle</i> of the same, not extending to the ends of the fingers, the
ends of which are furnished with very small nails. In like manner,
the very similar hair on the back of the foot does not extend
to the last “Phalangen?” of the middle toe. The nail of
the large outer toe is small, flat, and cut off short outside; that
of the fifth inner toe is a little larger and cut off abruptly on the
inner side. The very developed long nails of the three centre toes
are of the form of keeled tegulæ, and remote along their whole
length by the emarginations of the skin of the foot. The skin-flaps
of the foot are equally long; and usually those of the centre
toes are much smaller than the side ones, of which the outside
one (the great toe) is the broadest. The scrotum, under the anus,
is bare.—<i>Peters</i>, <i>l. c.</i> p. 277.</p>

<p>I have not seen this skull; but I believe the alteration Dr. Peters
made in his second paper is a mistake. The figure of the skull of his
<i>Otaria Philippii</i> has no resemblance to the skull of my <i>O. nigrescens</i>.
It is more nearly allied to the skull of <i>O. Stelleri</i> from California, agreeing
with it in having a vacant space with a pit in the bone between the
fourth and fifth upper grinders on each side, looking as if a grinder
had fallen out and the cavity had been filled up. The subgenus
<i>Arctophoca</i> of Dr. Peters’s first essay, not as modified in his second
one to contain <i>O. falklandica</i> (<i>nigrescens</i>), chiefly differs from Gill’s
genus <i>Eumetopias</i> (which was formed on my description and figure of
the skull of <i>O. Stelleri</i> or <i>californiana</i>) in the fifth upper grinder
not being so far back, but in a line with the back edge of the orbital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
process of the zygomatic arch instead of far behind it, as it is in
<i>Eumetopias</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Murie, most curiously, considers the skull described by Dr.
Peters to be the same as I have described as <i>O. Hookeri</i> (P. Z. S.
1869, p. 108).</p>

<p>Dr. Burmeister considered it <i>O. falklandica</i> of Shaw; and Mr.
Allen (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. vol. ii. p. 13) agrees in this opinion;
but further on (p. 15) he observes that both Dr. Gray and Dr. Murie
have “evidently overlooked the fact that Dr. Peters expressly states
that <i>O. Philippii</i> has a <i>thick under-fur</i>, whereas both the <i>O. Stelleri</i>
and the <i>O. Hookeri</i> are true <i>hair</i> Seals.” But, in fact, this statement
is a mistake as regards me; I never said that <i>O. Philippii</i> was the
same as <i>O. Stelleri</i>, but only that its skull was most nearly allied to
it, which I still maintain.</p>

<p>Head large, depressed. Teeth rudimentary; they never cut the
gums. Palate with transverse, fringed, horny plates of baleen.
Nostrils separate, longitudinal. Gullet very contracted. Tympanic
bones simple, large, cochleate, attached to an expanding periotic
bone, which forms part of the skull.</p>

<p>The baleen of the different Whales may be divided by its structure,
by its form, and by its colour. The form and structure often go
together.</p>

<p>The baleen consists of two parts:—1, the outer layer, called the
enamel coat; and, 2, the central fibres, which form the fringe on
the inner edge of the blade: both are well seen in cross sections
under the microscope. The outer coat or enamel differs in thickness
in the different kinds. Thus it is very thick and forms the greater
part of the blade in the Greenland Whale; and in different kinds it
gradually becomes thinner, until it only forms a thin coat over the
central fibres. The central longitudinal fibres differ in thickness
and in number. When they are very slender, as in the Greenland
Whale, they form only a single layer between the two coats of enamel,
and their produced ends make a very fine, long, flaccid fringe to
the inner edge of the blade. In other Whales they are very numerous,
in many series, and form a considerable part of the thickness
of the whalebone, and make a more or less broad and rigid fringe
to the blade. In some the fibres are so thick and rigid that they do
not droop, but form an erect ragged edge to the short and broad
blade, so rigid, indeed, that the fibres of this kind of whalebone are
used to make brushes and brooms.</p>

<p>The whalebone varies in form, from being narrow, elongate, many
times as long as it is broad at the base, by many gradations, according
to the families or genera, until it is not longer than broad.
The longest blades have the most enamel and the finest and most
flaccid fibres, which, on the other hand, gradually (as it belongs to
different genera) become coarser and more rigid as the whalebone
diminishes in length compared with its breadth.</p>

<p>The whalebone or baleen offers exceedingly good and permanent
characters for the distinction and characters of the species when
its structure and form and colour are properly studied. It is
stated that sometimes the character of the whalebone is changed by
its preparation, as, for example, being soaked in water for some time
before it is brought to this country; but the soaking, although it may
slightly alter the surface and make the enamel coat rather thinner,
does not alter the general form or microscopic structure of the
blades.</p>

<p>In my essay on Whales in the ‘Zoology of the Erebus &amp; Terror,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
1846, I separated the Right Whales, or Balænidæ, into two divisions—the
one having very slender, long, polished whalebone with a single
series of fringe, and the second with coarser, shorter, and broader
whalebone and a thick coarse fringe. The first was afterwards
called <i>Balæna</i>, and the second <i>Eubalæna</i>. M. Beneden seems
inclined to adopt this division (see ‘Ostéographie,’ Cétacés, p. 144),
observing that the former are confined to the Arctic regions and
the other to the more temperate zones; but this is not correct,
for <i>Balæna marginata</i>, as I stated in my first essay, has the whalebone
quite as polished and as fine as that of the Greenland Whale.
It lives on the west coast of Australia and New Zealand, in company
with the Black Whale of Australia and the Black Whale of
New Zealand (both of which, I have no doubt, have short coarse
whalebone). The Whale of the most northern parts of the Pacific
yields the north-west-coast whalebone, which is of a very coarse
character.</p>

<p>The first section of Whales, with long, slender, elastic, polished,
finely fringed whalebone, contains two genera, <i>Balæna</i> and <i>Neobalæna</i>.</p>

<p>The Whales of the second section, which have rough, brittle whalebone,
with a thick fringe of coarse hairs, includes four genera, viz.
<i>Eubalæna</i>, <i>Hunterius</i>, <i>Caperea</i>, and <i>Macleayius</i>.</p>

<p>It is very true that I have only seen the whalebone in one of these
genera, <i>Eubalæna</i>, in connexion with the bones of the animal; but
as “the South-sea whalers” (that is to say, those who fish in the
Southern and Pacific oceans) have only brought various examples of
this kind of whalebone from any of their voyages (except a few
blades of the whalebone of <i>B. marginata</i>, which they call “sea-tassel”),
we may naturally conclude that all the large Right Whales
found in those seas have this kind of whalebone.</p>

<p>Capt. Maury’s Whale-Charts show that Right Whales are found
in almost all seas, from the poles to within 35 or 30 degrees of latitude
on each side of the equator. An experienced whaler observes
that “Right Whales are as seldom seen in that belt as Sperm-Whales
are found out of it.” Capt. Maury justly observes, the torrid zone
is to these animals “forbidden ground, and it is as physically impossible
for them to cross the equator as it would be to cross a sea of
flame. In short, these researches show that there is a belt of from
two to three thousand miles in breadth, and reaching from one side
of the ocean to the other, in which the Right Whale is never found.”—<i>Maury</i>,
<i>Whale-Charts</i>, p. 233.</p>

<p>Prof. Van Beneden, in a paper to the Royal Belgian Academy, and
reproduced enlarged in the ‘Ostéographie—Cétacés,’ gives a geographical
distribution of Whales. He acknowledges only six species,
having the following distribution:—</p>

<p>1. <i>B. mysticetus.</i> The Arctic Ocean on both sides of Greenland,
and on the coast of Siberia to the Sea of Okhotsk.</p>

<p>2. <i>B. biscayensis.</i> The North Atlantic, from latitude 65° to 45°,
and a belt across the Atlantic to the coast of the United States, from
lat. 45° to 50°.</p>

<p>3. <i>B. japonica.</i> A band across the North Pacific from lat. 60° to
45° on the west coast of America and 45° to 30° on the coast of
Japan.</p>

<p>4. <i>B. australis.</i> A belt across the South Atlantic, from lat. 25°
to 30° on the south-west coast of Africa and lat. 35° to 50° on the
coast of South America.</p>

<p>5. <i>B. antipodarum.</i> In a similar belt across the South Pacific
from the west coast of South America, in lat. 45°, to New Zealand.</p>

<p>6. A species which he does not name, said to inhabit a belt from
Natal to the south-east part of Australia, about lat. 30°.</p>

Hist. 1868, vol. i. p. 242, and 1870, vol. vi. p. 193, in which he observes
“I think I have proved that M. van Beneden’s theory is

<p>Dr. Robert Brown gives an account and notes of the habits and
migrations of this animal. He observes:—“Where the Whale goes
to in winter is still unknown. It is said that it leaves Davis Strait
about the month of November, and produces young in the St. Lawrence
River, between Quebec and Camaroa, returning to Davis Strait
in the spring. At all events, early in the year they are found on
the coast of Labrador, where the English whalers occasionally attack
them; but the ships arrive generally too late, and the weather at
that season is too tempestuous to render the ‘south-west fishing’
very attractive.... It is said that early in September they enter
Cumberland (Hogarth’s) Sound in great numbers, and remain until
it is completely frozen up, which, according to the Eskimo account,
is not until January.... They enter the Sound again in the spring,
and remain until the heat of summer has melted off the land-floes
in these comparatively southern latitudes. It thus appears that
they winter and produce their young all along the broken water off
the southern coasts of Hudson’s Strait, Davis Strait, and Labrador.”</p>

<p>He continues, “I am strongly of belief that the Whales of the
Spitzbergen sea never, as a body, visit Davis Strait, but winter
somewhere in the open water at the southern edge of the northern
ice-fields. The Whales are being gradually driven further north.”</p>

<p>It has been ascertained, “1st, that it is much more active than the
Greenland Whale, much quicker and more violent in its movements,
and accordingly both more difficult and dangerous to capture; 2nd,
that it is smaller (it being, however, impossible to give an exact
statement of its length) and has much less blubber; 3rd, that its
head is shorter, and that its whalebone is comparatively small and
scarcely more than half the length of that of the <i>B. mysticetus</i>;
4th, that it is regularly infested with a cirriped belonging to the
genus <i>Coronula</i>, and that it belongs to the temperate North Atlantic
as exclusively as the <i>B. mysticetus</i> belongs to the icy sea.”—<i>Dr.
Brown</i>, <i>P. Z. S.</i> 1868, p. 546.</p>

<p>Dr. Brown says that barnacles are looked upon as a sign of age in
a Whale; and he considers that a considerable portion of the description

<p>In width and general form the beak of the skull is somewhat
like the beak of some of the Finner Whales; but it does not at all
justify Mr. Knox’s idea that <i>Balæna marginata</i> is a Finner. But
this difference of skull makes us more anxious to have the description<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
of the entire animal and its skeleton, as the animal may prove
to be the type of a new family of Whales, between the true Whales
and Finners.</p>

<p>This pigmy whale, which is not more than 15 or 16 feet long, is
a representative in the Southern Ocean of the gigantic Right Whale
of the Greenland seas. It has the most beautiful, the most flexible,
most elastic, and the toughest whalebone or baleen yet discovered;
and if this were of larger size, it would fetch a much higher price than
the whalebone of the Greenland Whale, the latter being three or four
times the value of the brittle coarse whalebone of the <i>Eubalænæ</i> or
Right Whales of the Southern and Pacific Oceans. The trade of the
Continental nations being chiefly confined to their colonies, or their
merchants obtaining the whalebone that is used in their manufactures
second-hand, there are not in the market the varieties of whalebone
and finner-bone which we have in this country, where the whalebone
and finner-bone from different localities bear each a different
value. This perhaps explains why the Continental zoologists (as
Eschricht) who have paid attention to the structure of whales have
not paid sufficient attention to the characters afforded by the shape,
structure, and colour of this substance, to which I called their attention
more than twenty years ago, and showed its value as a character
for distinguishing the genera and species. It has been a
fertile subject of reproach to me that I established some species on
the characters afforded by this substance; but I need only mention, as
a proof of the little attention Van Beneden has paid to this part of
my work, that in his book on the anatomy of Whales, now in progress,
after saying that I have established the species <i>Balæna marginata</i>
on three blades of whalebone, he says I have called it <i>Eubalæna
marginata</i>, thus confounding it with the Whales with brittle
and coarse whalebone—whereas the chief reason that induced me to
consider the blades to belong to a distinct species was their very fine
and tough structure. The accuracy of the determination is now proved
by the very different form of its skull from that of any other known
Whale. In the same manner, the <i>Physalus antarcticus</i>, also established
on finner-bone or baleen imported from New Zealand, has
been proved to be a very distinct species of that genus, named Sulphur-bottoms
by the whalers.</p>

<p>From the description given at page 90 of the British-Museum
‘Catalogue of Seals and Whales,’ there is no doubt that the baleen
corresponds with the above species. The specimen was obtained at
Kawau Island by Sir George Grey, and appears to be unique, as the
species has hitherto only been known from the baleen.</p>

<p>“Knox now admits that this is not the Sulphur-bottom, which he
says is the Trigger of the New-Zealand whalers. He fancies that
<i>B. marginata</i> may be the true Finner of the south. I will try to
find some more of the bones.”—<i>Trans. New Zeal. Inst.</i> 1870,
p. 26.</p>

<p>This Whale, from the form and structure of the whalebone, cannot
be a Finner, but is certainly, as I arranged it, a true Right
Whale, very nearly allied to the Right Whale of Greenland, and of
a very small size. The bones of this Whale would be a most valuable
addition to the British Museum or any zoological museum.
They appear not to be uncommon in the Kawau Islands; and the
measurements of the skull are a valuable addition to our knowledge
of the species.</p>

<p>This small Right Whale of the Antarctic Sea is the representative
of the Right Whale in the Arctic Sea, and, judging from the length
of the head, cannot be more than 14 or 15 feet long, while the
Greenland Whale is from 50 to 65 feet long.</p>

<p>First rib ⸺? Baleen ⸺? Tympanic bones irregular,
rhombic; aperture irregular, much contracted at the upper end;
the wide part not half the length of the bone. “Cervical vertebræ
all united. First rib single at the upper, and very broad at the
lower end. Bladebone (acromion) rudimentary. Coracoid process
none.”—<i>Lilljeborg.</i></p>

<p>Vertebræ 55; the seven cervical all soldered by their bodies, and
the spinous processes of the first five united into a single crest, and
of the two last into a separate crest; each has a distinct upper lateral
process and, except the seventh, a distinct lateral process. Upper
lateral process of the atlas narrow, square, reflexed, and bent upwards;
lower one thick, enlarged, and rounded at the end (Ostéogr.
Cét. t. 3. f. 4, 5). Scapula with only a slight ridge in the place of

<p>Mr. Cope “mentioned that he had an opportunity of examining a
portion of a specimen of the Scrag Whale of Dudley, <i>Balæna gibbosa</i>
of Erxleben, and ascertained that it represented a genus not previously
known. It was a Fin-back Whale; but without dorsal fin or
throat-folds, resembling superficially the genus <i>Balæna</i>. The <i>baleen
short and curved</i>. The genus was called <i>Agaphelus</i>.”</p>

<h5>1. AGAPHELUS.</h5>

<p>Cervical vertebræ free. Fingers 4. Throat without plaits. No
dorsal fin. Ribs single-headed. Scapula with acromion (Cope,

<p>“Fingers four, elongate. Cervical vertebræ ⸺? Lumbar
and anterior caudal vertebræ longer than their greatest diameter.
Dorsal fin wanting. Gular and pectoral region without folds. Scapula
with well-developed acromion and coracoid. Baleen narrow,
short, curved.</p>

<p>“The baleen is peculiar; throughout the length of the maxillary
bone it nowhere exceeded one foot in length, and the width of the
band, or length of the base of each plate, four inches. It is of a
creamy white; the fringe very coarse, white, and resembling hogs’
bristles.</p>

<p>“The ear-bone is much compressed, with an inferior carina,
towards which the lip of dense bone is suddenly decurved. The
longitudinal opening is much contracted, especially anteriorly, where
the bone is pinched up into a keel; and there is no abrupt concavity
of the inner lip at that point. External surface not very rugose.
Total length 3 in. 2·5 lines.</p>

<p>“The scapula preserved is low and elongate, with well-developed
acromion and coracoid process. It is evidently of the type of <i>Balænoptera</i>
and <i>Physalus</i>; the ulna and radius relatively less elongate
than in <i>Sibbaldius laticeps</i> and <i>borealis</i>, being 1·5 as long as the
humerus, thus resembling <i>Physalus</i>.</p>

<p>“The four fingers, with the second much the longest, form a fin
of the type of those genera.</p>

<p>“The ear-bone is much more compressed than in <i>Physalus antiquorum</i>
or <i>Sibbaldius laticeps</i>.</p>

<p>“The mandibular ramus is rather massive, moderately curved, and
with a more elevated coronoid process than in any Whale that I have
seen.</p>

<p>“The greatest peculiarity is in the form of the lumbar and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
anterior caudal vertebræ; they are of a much more elongate form
than any I have seen or found figured, excepting those of the <i>Balænoptera
rostrata</i> (as figured by Gaimard in ‘Voyage de la Recherche’),
which, however, are relatively shorter. Those of the present species
are of greater length than transverse diameter, the lumbars most
elongate; all furnished with an acute hypapophysial keel and concave
sides, and entirely transverse diapophyses. This peculiarity is
consistent with the account of my informant, who stated the animal
to have been of an unusually elongate and slender form. When it
came ashore it had perhaps been dead ten days; the flukes and
muscular region as far as the third caudal vertebra had been devoured,
probably by Sharks and Killers, and the abdominal region
much lacerated; the edge of a fin preserved was slit by the teeth of
some carnivorous enemy. The measurement from the end of the
muzzle to the end of the third caudal was 35 feet, which may be
reduced to 33 feet axial. Up to this point the dorsal line was, according
to my informant, entirely smooth, without knob or fin, or
scar of one; hence I suppose the fin (if present) to have been situated,
as in <i>Sibbaldius</i> &amp;c., at the posterior fourth of the length, and
not, as in <i>Balænoptera</i>, on the posterior third. It may then be safely
assumed, bearing in mind the form of vertebræ, that ten feet of the
whale’s length had been removed, making in all 43 feet. That the
species attains over 50 feet is probable, as the present individual
was quite young, the epiphyses separating from the vertebræ with
the greatest ease. The slender form of the animal is corroborated
by the slenderness and slight curvature of the ribs, one attached
beneath the scapula, probably the second, being narrower than the
corresponding ones in <i>Sibbaldius</i>. I therefore think it most probable
that in this form the anterior ribs are single-headed.”—<i>Cope</i>, <i>l. c.</i>

<p>“The points in which this species differs from those of the genus
<i>Balæna</i> previously known are numerous, and will no doubt be increased
on a further knowledge of the animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“The head, between one-fourth and one-fifth of the total length,
allies it to the shorter-headed species. From the <i>B. australis</i> the
number of dorsal vertebræ, and the colour and shortness of the baleen,
distinguish it; and no doubt other features will be brought out when
we are acquainted with the Cape species. The dorsal serration is
not known to occur in any species of the genus <i>Balæna</i>, though said
to be characteristic of the <i>A. gibbosus</i>, whose characters I have just
given.</p>

<p>“Two <i>Balænæ</i> have been described as inhabiting the North Pacific
Ocean, <i>Balæna Sieboldii</i>, Gray (Catal. Cet. 1865, p. 96), and <i>Balæna
cullamach</i>, Chamisso (Nov. Act. Acad. Cæs. xii. p. 251, tab.)</p>

<p>“Both have been established on figures carved by the natives, of
the Japanese and Aleutian Islands respectively, the former under the
supervision of a naturalist, the traveller Siebold. The carving of
the <i>B. cullamach</i>, judging from the figure given by Chamisso, can
but doubtfully represent any species; but if the species exist, it will
rest on the following diagnosis of its describer:—‘Rictu amplo forma
litteræ S curvato, elasmiis maximis atro-cæruleis, spiraculis flexuosis,
in medio capite, tuberculo in apice rostri (ex imagine), pectore pinnisque
pectoralibus albis, dorso gibboso sexpinnato.’</p>

<p>“These are, however, true <i>Balænæ</i>. A species of <i>Agaphelus</i>
exists in the Kamtschatkan seas, according to Pallas, who, however,
derives his information solely from wooden models made by the
Aleutian Islanders. This is not sufficient basis for an introduction
to the scientific system; yet Pallas indulges in applying to it the name
<i>Balæna agamachschik</i>. The pectoral limb of this species is said,
however, to be white, with the underside of the flukes, characters
not found in the <i>A. glaucus</i>. Dr. Gray has already (Cat. Brit. Mus.)
indicated that this, if reliable, indicates a genus unknown to him.</p>

<p>“The <i>Agaphelus glaucus</i> is the Grey Whale of the coasts of California.
Two specimens have been examined by my friend Wm. H.
Dall, of the scientific staff of the U. S. Russian-American Telegraph
Expedition, one of them near Monterey; and descriptions, as complete
as the state of the specimens would allow, were made.</p>

<p>“These, which were sent to the Smithsonian Institution, and
placed in my hands by Prof. Baird, are quite sufficient to indicate a
Whale of a species hitherto unnoticed, and to render certain its
future identification.</p>

<p>“A second and more full examination of the <i>Megaptera osphyia</i>,
Cope, furnishes the following additional points and characters. The
specimen is young, and measures in its present condition 34 feet.
It has, however, lost a considerable number of caudal vertebræ, and,
from the posterior part of the column, of intervertebral cartilages
also; add to this the shrinking of the cartilages preserved, and the
increase of length would perhaps amount to 8 feet, giving 42 in all.
The asserted length of 50 feet, line measurement, which I quoted in
my original description, is no doubt an exaggeration.</p>

<p>“The glenoid process is margined by an angular prominence, the
rudiment of the coracoid, precisely as in the <i>M. brasiliensis</i>. The
diapophysis of the atlas is a flat vertical plate, extending from opposite
the base of the <i>foramen dentatum</i> to opposite the widest point
of the spinal canal; inferior posterior outline of the atlas broad,
slightly concave mesially. The mandible is peculiar in the strong
angular process, which extends from behind, round the side, projecting
as far as the condyle, and separated from it by a deep groove.
The third and fourth cervicals are united by the neural arch. The
first rib is very broad at the extremity; length 37 inches, width at
end 8·22 inches. The orbital processes of the frontal bone are not
contracted at the extremities as in <i>M. longimana</i>, but are more as in
<i>Balænopteræ</i>; entire width over and within edge of orbit 15½ in.;
length to vertical plate of maxillary 31 inches. The baleen measures
2 feet in length, is black, with three rows of coarse bristles.
Its base is one curve; its length is spirally twisted. The species is
probably one of the largest of the <i>Balænidæ</i>.”—<i>Cope</i>, <i>Proc. Acad.

<p>Mr. Flower (Trans. Zool. Soc. vol. vi.) considers <i>C. australis</i>,
Gray, <i>l. c.</i> p. 206, fig. 55, the same species; and certainly there does
not appear to be any character in the skeleton to divide them.</p>

<p>Maury remarks:—“The Sperm-Whale, according to the result of
this chart, appears never to double the Cape of Good Hope. It
doubles Cape Horn. Since this fish delights in warm water, shall
we not expect to find off Cape Horn an under-current of warm
water heavier with its salt?”—<i>Maury</i>, <i>Whale-Charts</i>, p. 267.</p>

<p>How far the species indicated range beyond the habitats whence
they were received is yet to be discovered and recorded. No doubt
their range is influenced by many local circumstances (peculiarities
in the currents, and disposition of the food) that are not easily observed

<p>Mr. Flower has no faith in Sibbald’s account of this animal, and
says, “If the Linnæan genus <i>Physeter</i> is to be kept in abeyance

<p>The difference between <i>Kogia</i> and <i>Euphysetes</i> does not depend on
the sex of the animals. Mr. Krefft described a male, and Professor
Owen a female specimen; the latter mistook the two drawings of
the same specimen for the two sexes, deceived by certain additions
surreptitiously made to Mr. Elliot’s drawings; but the additions,
especially the penis, are not represented on the plates, and the artist
(Mr. Willis) says he received no directions to leave out any part of
the drawing, and accurately copied them. The measurements given
in the paper do not agree with those in Mr. Elliot’s notes made from
the living animal; and reference to them would have prevented all
this confusion.</p>

<p>The beak of the skull from the notch rather shorter than from
the notch to the condyle, depressed, flat above, gradually tapering
in front; the width at the notch two-thirds of the entire length of
the beak. Lower jaw slender, narrow and thin in front, teeth not
reaching the notch.</p>

<p>This reexamination has convinced me, and also, I believe, Mr.
Flower, that the skull described under the name of <i>Orca intermedia</i>
belongs to a very small species, and is not “the skull of a very
young individual, probably of one of the large species,” as Mr.
Flower supposed, apparently from the examination of the figure
(see Flower, P. Z. S. 1864, p. 425). Indeed, when the animal
is known, I should not be at all astonished if it should prove to be
a species of <i>Electra</i> rather than of <i>Orca</i>, or perhaps a new genus.</p>

<p>This skull has many resemblances to those of some of the species
of <i>Electra</i>; the teeth are much smaller than those of <i>Orca</i>.</p>

<p>This is the skull of a full-grown animal, and yet it is not so

judging from the figure, believed it to be the skull of a very young
animal; but on examining the skull along with me he became
satisfied, from the solidity and definite form of the bones, that it is
the skull of a full-grown though not aged specimen.</p>

Surg. no. 1139); Seychelles Islands (<i>Swinburne Ward</i>).</p>

<p>In the Cape specimen the intermaxillaries are nearly of the same
width in the whole of their length; in the Seychelles skull they are
contracted in the greater part of their length, and rather dilated in
front.</p>

<p>Mr. Swinburne Ward has kindly sent a very beautiful skull of a
“Killer” taken in the sea near the Seychelle Islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>To determine this skull I have been induced to compare the skulls
of the genus in the British Museum, which it is very necessary to do
from time to time, as specimens gradually accumulate, and often
arrive when I am occupied on other subjects, and consequently are
put aside for future examination.</p>

<p>In this examination I have observed that in the ‘Catalogue of
Seals and Whales’ I have confounded with the skull described under
the name of <i>Orca capensis</i> one from the North Pacific, the former
being the true <i>Orca capensis</i>, and the skull now received from the
Seychelles Islands being of the same species.</p>

<p>The skull figured in the ‘Zoology of the Erebus and Terror’ under
the name of <i>O. capensis</i> is from a specimen received from the Zoological
Society, to which it was presented by Capt. Delville, who said
he obtained it in the North Pacific (?). It is quite a different species,
for which I propose the name of <i>Orca pacifica</i>. I doubt its being
from the <i>North</i> Pacific, as I believe there is a skull of the same
species in the Paris Museum, collected by M. Eydoux, and said to
have come from Chili.</p>

<p>The skull very similar to that of the Cape species, but much
smaller; but the beak is rather narrower, the intermaxillaries moderately
broad, slightly dilated in front.</p>

<p>Inhab. North Sea.</p>

<p>An adult skull from the coast of Essex (361 <i>a</i>), and another without
the lower jaw, are in the British Museum.</p>

<p>These skulls of the smaller British, or, rather, European <i>Orca</i> are
distinguishable from those of <i>O. gladiator</i> by the smaller size and
the broader, rounder nose—and from the skulls of the Cape-of-Good-Hope
species by being of a much smaller species, and having a depressed
crown of the head.</p>

<p>I believe the skull figured under the name of <i>Delphinus orca</i> by
Cuvier, Oss. Foss. vol. v. tab. 22. figs. 3, 4, represents this species,
from the form of the beak and the narrowness of the occiput: this
figure has been copied by various British and other authors.</p>

<p>Gervais, in the ‘Zoology and Paleontology of France,’ figures the
skull of a young <i>Delphinus orca</i>, taken on the coast of Cette, which
is now in the Museum of Paris. It appears to belong to this species;
or it may be that the <i>Orca</i> of the Mediterranean does not grow
to the usual size; or, again, it may be of a different species; for the
skull is only fifty-eight centimetres long and thirty broad.</p>

<p>Head rounded in front. Teeth in both jaws more or less early
deciduous, rarely wanting or, rather, not developed. Back without
any dorsal fin. Pectoral fin small, ovate. Skull with the lateral
expansion of the maxilla over the orbit, and the side of the beak,
shelving downwards. Fingers short; index and middle fingers
nearly the same length, the rest rather shorter; phalanges 2, 5, 6, 4, 3.

<p>“The Narwhal and the <i>Beluga</i> appear to separate themselves
from all the rest, by certain well-marked structural conditions,
especially the characters of the cervical vertebræ. As these two
animals are in almost every part of their skeleton nearly identical,
even to the number of the vertebræ and phalanges, I am disposed to
look upon the exceptional dentition of the former as an aberration of
secondary importance, and to unite the two genera into a distinct
subfamily, placing it next to the Platanistidæ.”—<i>Flower</i>, <i>l. c.</i> p. 114.</p>

<p>The animal figured by Gervais as <i>Delphinus (Stenodelphis) Blainvillii</i>

having an elongated subfalcate pectoral fin, and a higher dorsal, and
a broad white streak, commencing from the blower and extending
down the back to near the tail. If this is not a figure of the animal
seen at sea, which I suspect it must be, it must be a different species.</p>

<p>“The specimen was cast on the beach on the west coast, and
prepared by Dr. Knox.”—<i>Hector.</i></p>

<p>“Your <i>Berardius</i> proves to be quite different from the first one
we got, both in the dentition and form of the skull. We have had
several good papers on it from Dr. Knox. He has made a beautiful
preparation, showing that the tooth does not pass through the
gum.”—<i>Dr. Hector</i>, letter dated 30th October, 1870.</p>

<p>“A fine specimen of <i>Berardius arnuxi</i> has been cast ashore on
the coast of Canterbury, New Zealand. It was made into a skeleton,
which is now in the museum at Canterbury. The skeleton is
complete, only wanting one of the pelvic bones. It was 30 feet
long, and a young animal; not a single epiphysis is anchylosed.
The cervical vertebræ, which, in the old animal evidently form a
compact mass, are still partly free; the first three vertebræ (including
the atlas) anchylosed, and of these the first two completely,
and of the second and third the neural arches are as yet not completely
united into one bone. It has ten ribs.”—<i>Julius Haast.</i></p>

<p>The animal was 30 feet 6 inches long.</p>

<p>Deep velvet-black, belly greyish, tail with two falcate lobes
6½ feet broad. The pectoral fins are little above the middle of
the body, 17 inches broad and 19 inches long, of a triangular form.
Dorsal fin small, falcate, not very far from the chin (?). “The
animal has the power of protruding the four teeth at will.” They
live on cephalopods. The stomach contained about a half-bushel of
the horny beaks of the <i>Octopus</i>, which were nearly all the same
size. It was evidently a young animal, as all the disk-like epiphyses
of the vertebræ are still separate, as was the case with
the limb-bones.</p>

<p>The seven cervical vertebræ were beginning to coalesce; the first
three are already anchylosed, the first two completely, and the
second and third only partially, as the neural arches and transverse
processes are not yet united in one bone. It has ten dorsal vertebræ;
the lumbar and caudal vertebræ were not observed. (Dr.
Haast, Annals &amp; Mag. Nat. Hist., Oct. 1870.)</p>

<p>The form of the lower jaw gives a very peculiar appearance to
the skeleton. The cervical vertebræ are united together by their
bodies and large dorsal spines, the latter forming a thick conical
process. The bodies of the dorsal vertebræ are very small, enlarging
in size towards the tail; they are thirty-six in number.
The four terminal caudal ones are very small, forming a kind
of cylindrical process. There are eight chevron bones. The thoracic
cavity is small. There are twelve ribs on each side. The
dorsal processes of the first eighteen vertebræ have an anterior basal
process, which becomes gradually smaller.</p>

<p>Upper arm-bone very slender, slightly curved; the lower arm-bones
moderate, straight, parallel to each other, and rather longer
than the upper arm-bone. The ribs very broad at the upper end,
and gradually tapering towards the chest, where they are nearly
cylindrical.</p>

<p>“The total length of the skeleton, without cartilage, is 14 feet
8 inches; the head measures 2 feet 5½ inches in length, and the
lower jaw 2 feet 3 inches in length. The first three cervical vertebræ
are anchylosed; the next one is more or less free; and the
remaining three are anchylosed again. The dorsals are ten in
number, the last bearing a short rib 8 inches in length. Five of
these ribs are jointed direct to the sternum; the following two meet
the cartilage of the fifth rib.</p>

<p>“The sternum is composed of four pieces, 20 inches long, with a
width of between 5 and 7 inches. It is not yet sufficiently cleaned
to enable me to have it photographed; this, however, will be done as
soon as possible, and copies forwarded to the Society. The lumbars
number twenty, the last nine having V-bones attached. The fifth
lumbar is 17½ inches high, 4 inches wide at the top, and 11¾ inches
at the base, including the side processes. The eleventh lumbar is
the widest, being 4¾ inches at the top. The caudals probably
amounted to 13; but five of these are missing; the basal one is very
small, about the size of a pea; and as it was firmly attached to the
second last, there can be no mistake about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>“The head is 2 feet 5½ inches long
and 14 inches across at the widest
part; the lower jaw 2 feet 3 inches
long and 6¼ inches high behind the
tooth. The left tooth measures 6 inches
in length, 3⅜ inches in width, and is
1¾ inch thick [not well represented in
the figure]. The space between the
teeth measures 7¼ inches. The limbs
are very imperfect; all the smaller
bones are missing; and there is only
a part of one scapula. I did not find
the pelvic bones.</p>

a year ago, near Lord Howe’s Island.”—<i>Krefft</i>,

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
